## Why Schemathesis?

Schemathesis focuses on automating your API testing to catch crashes and spec violations. Built on top of the widely-used <a href="https://hypothesis.works/" target="_blank">Hypothesis</a> framework for property-based testing, it offers the following advantages:

üïí **Time-Saving**

Automatically generates test cases, freeing you from manual test writing.

üîç **Comprehensive**

Utilizes fuzzing techniques to probe both common and edge-case scenarios, including those you might overlook.

üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible**

Supports OpenAPI, GraphQL, and can work even with partially complete schemas. Only the parts describing data generation or responses are required.

üéõÔ∏è **Customizable**

Customize the framework by writing Python extensions to modify almost any aspect of the testing process.

üîÑ **Reproducible**

Generates code samples to help you quickly replicate and investigate any failing test cases.

## Quick Demo

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/master/img/demo.gif)

## Getting Started

Choose from multiple ways to start testing your API with Schemathesis.

> üí° Your API schema can be either a URL or a local path to a JSON/YAML file.

### üíª Command-Line Interface

Quick and easy for those who prefer the command line.

**Python**

1. Install via pip: `python -m pip install schemathesis`
2. Run tests

```bash
st run --checks all https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json
```

**Docker**

1. Pull Docker image: `docker pull schemathesis/schemathesis:stable`
2. Run tests

```bash
docker run schemathesis/schemathesis:stable
   run --checks all https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json
```

### üêç Python Library

For more control and customization, integrate Schemathesis into your Python codebase.

1. Install via pip: `python -m pip install schemathesis`
2. Add to your tests:

```python
import schemathesis

schema = schemathesis.from_uri("https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json")


@schema.parametrize()
def test_api(case):
    case.call_and_validate()
```

> üí° See a complete working example project in the [/example](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/tree/master/example) directory.

### :octocat: GitHub Integration

**GitHub Actions**

Run Schemathesis tests as a part of your CI/CD pipeline.

Add this YAML configuration to your GitHub Actions:

```yaml
api-tests:
  runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
  steps:
    - uses: schemathesis/action@v1
      with:
        schema: "https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json"
        # OPTIONAL. Add Schemathesis.io token for pull request reports
        token: ${{ secrets.SCHEMATHESIS_TOKEN }}
```

For more details, check out our [GitHub Action](https://github.com/schemathesis/action) repository.

**GitHub App**

Receive automatic comments in your pull requests and updates on GitHub checks status. Requires usage of our SaaS platform.

1. Install the [GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/schemathesis).
2. Enable in your repository settings.

### Software as a Service

If you prefer an all-in-one solution with quick setup, we have a [free tier](https://schemathesis.io/#pricing) available.

## How it works

Here‚Äôs a simplified overview of how Schemathesis operates:

1. **Test Generation**: Using the API schema to create a test generator that you can fine-tune to your testing requirements.
2. **Execution and Adaptation**: Sending tests to the API and adapting through statistical models and heuristics to optimize subsequent cases based on responses.
3. **Analysis and Minimization**: Checking responses to identify issues. Minimizing means simplifying failing test cases for easier debugging.
4. **Stateful Testing**: Running multistep tests to assess API operations in both isolated and integrated scenarios.
5. **Reporting**: Generating detailed reports with insights and cURL commands for easy issue reproduction.

### Research Findings on Open-Source API Testing Tools

Our study, presented at the **44th International Conference on Software Engineering**, highlighted Schemathesis's performance:

- **Defect Detection**: identified a total of **755 bugs** in **16 services**, finding between **1.4√ó to 4.5√ó more defects** than the second-best tool in each case.

- **High Reliability**: consistently operates seamlessly on any project, ensuring unwavering stability and reliability.

"_Schemathesis is the only sane way to thoroughly test an API._"

<div>Zdenek Nemec - <strong>superface.ai</strong></div>

---

"_The tool is absolutely amazing as it can do the negative scenario testing instead of me and much faster! Before I was doing the same tests in Postman client. But it's much slower and brings maintenance burden._"

<div>Ludƒõk Nov√Ω - <strong>JetBrains</strong></div>

"_Schemathesis is the best tool for fuzz testing of REST API on the market. We are at Red Hat use it for examining our applications in functional and integrations testing levels._"

<div>Dmitry Misharov - <strong>RedHat</strong></div>

---

"_There are different levels of usability and documentation quality among these tools which have been reported, where Schemathesis clearly stands out among the most user-friendly and industry-strength tools._"
