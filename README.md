### Highlights

üéØ **Catches Hard-to-Find Bugs**

- Uncover hidden crashes and edge cases that manual testing might miss
- Identify spec violations and ensure your API adheres to its contract

‚ö° **Accelerates Testing Cycles**

- Automatically generate a wide range of test cases based on your API schema
- Save time by reducing the need for manual test case creation

üß© **Integrates Seamlessly**

- Works with popular API formats such as OpenAPI, GraphQL.
- Easily integrate into your existing CI/CD workflows.

üîß **Customizable and Extendable**

- Tune the testing process using Python extensions.
- Adjust the testing flow to suit your needs with rich configuration options.

üêû **Simplifies Debugging**

- Get detailed reports to identify and fix issues quickly.
- Reproduce failing test cases with cURL commands.

üî¨ **Proven by Research**

- Validated through academic studies on API testing automation
- Featured in [ICSE 2022 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9793781) on semantics-aware fuzzing
- Recognized in [ACM survey](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3617175) as state-of-the-art RESTful API testing tool

## Installation

Use Schemathesis via Docker, or install it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/schemathesis/)

```console
# Via Docker.
$ docker pull schemathesis/schemathesis:stable

# With pip.
$ pip install schemathesis
```

## Getting Started

Schemathesis works as a standalone CLI:

```console
docker run schemathesis/schemathesis:stable
   run --checks all https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json
# Or when installed with pip
schemathesis run --checks all https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json
```

Or a Python library:

```python
import schemathesis

schema = schemathesis.from_uri("https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json")


@schema.parametrize()
def test_api(case):
    case.call_and_validate()
```

See a complete working example project in the [/example](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/tree/master/example) directory.

Schemathesis can be easily integrated into your CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Add this block to your GitHub Actions to run Schemathesis against your API:

```yaml
api-tests:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: schemathesis/action@v1
      with:
        schema: "https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json"
        # OPTIONAL. Add Schemathesis.io token for pull request reports
        token: ${{ secrets.SCHEMATHESIS_TOKEN }}
```

For more details, check out our [GitHub Action](https://github.com/schemathesis/action) repository or see our [GitHub Tutorial](https://docs.schemathesis.io/tutorials/github).

"_Schemathesis is the only sane way to thoroughly test an API._"

<div>Zdenek Nemec - <strong>superface.ai</strong></div>

---

"_The tool is absolutely amazing as it can do the negative scenario testing instead of me and much faster! Before I was doing the same tests in Postman client. But it's much slower and brings maintenance burden._"

<div>Ludƒõk Nov√Ω - <strong>JetBrains</strong></div>

---

"_Schemathesis is the best tool for fuzz testing of REST API on the market. We are at Red Hat use it for examining our applications in functional and integrations testing levels._"

<div>Dmitry Misharov - <strong>RedHat</strong></div>

---

"_There are different levels of usability and documentation quality among these tools which have been reported, where Schemathesis clearly stands out among the most user-friendly and industry-strength tools._"
