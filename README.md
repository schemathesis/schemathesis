  <i>Automatically finding specification violations and server errors</i>
</p>

> **Note:** This is the V4 branch under active development. While fully functional and passing tests, some features may be missing, and documentation is being updated. For the stable release, see the [V3 branch](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/tree/v3).

- üîç **Schema-Based Generation** - Creates test cases directly from your API documentation
- üõ°Ô∏è **Zero Configuration** - Works immediately with any valid OpenAPI or GraphQL schema
- üîÑ **Advanced Testing Techniques** - Employs stateful testing, boundary analysis, and fuzzing
