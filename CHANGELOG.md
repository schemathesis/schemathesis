- Improved failure messages for `unsupported_method` and `missing_required_header` checks.
- Restore `Case.formatted_path`.
- Update serialization error messages.
- Update documentation links in error messages.

### :bug: Fixed

- Internal error during negative testing in some cases on Open API 3.1.

- **Pytest**: Ignored `headers` from config file.
- Make header overrides case-insensitive.

## [4.0.0-alpha.12](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v4.0.0-alpha.11...v4.0.0-alpha.12) - 2025-06-02

This release features rewritten documentation, now live at https://schemathesis.github.io/schemathesis/

What's included:

- Quick Start Guide and tutorial
- 8 practical how-to guides
- Core concepts and architecture explanations
- Complete CLI, configuration, and Python API reference

Coming in the next release:

- Pytest integration guide
- Remaining pytest-specific API documentation

This should be the final alpha release. Going forward, I'll focus on documentation improvements, feature polish, and providing a migration guide for the stable release.

### :rocket: Added

- A way to configure status codes for the `not_a_server_error` check. [#2539](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/2539) 
- `@schemathesis.serializer` decorator as a way to serialize data of media types not supported by Schemathesis.

### :bug: Fixed

- **Coverage phase**: Incorrect reference resolution scope during test generation
- Do not show the `operation returned only 4xx responses during unit tests` warning if the API operation only returned HTTP 500 responses.
- Internal error inside `ignored_auth` in negative testing mode.
- Do not show additional Hypothesis notes on errors during CLI execution.
- Internal error on `ChunkedEncodingError`.
- Headers automatically added by HTTP libraries (e.g., `Accept`) are now correctly omitted during negative testing for missing required headers.

### :wrench: Changed

- Run positive and negative tests by default.
- Add timestamps to report filenames to avoid rewriting exiting report in subsequent runs.
- Coverage phase no longer emits duplicate query parameter names by default. The `phases.coverage.generate-duplicate-query-parameters` config option allows for controlling this behavior.
- Report cURL commands for some network-level errors (connection resets, server crashes). [#2709](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/2709)
- Cleanup pytest output. [#2714](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/2714)
- Clarify warnings and make them configurable. [#2761](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/2761)
- Rename entities related to Targeted Property-based testing. `schemathesis.target` -> `schemathesis.metric`, `TargetContext` -> `MetricContext`

### :fire: Removed

- `--contrib-openapi-fill-missing-examples`. Use `[phases.examples]` configuration table instead:

```toml
[phases.coverage]
fill-missing = true
```

## [4.0.0-alpha.11](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v4.0.0-alpha.10...v4.0.0-alpha.11) - 2025-05-26

### :rocket: Added

Introducing `schemathesis.toml` as a configuration file for Schemathesis.

It provides fine-grained control over individual API operations and supports multi-project configurations. Global settings go at the top level, with dedicated sections for operations and projects.

CLI options override configuration file settings when specified.

Example:

```toml
# Default settings for any project
base-url = "https://api.example.com"

# Settings specific to `GET /users`
[[operations]]
include-name = "GET /users"
request-timeout = 5.0

# Specific to Payments API matched by `info.title`
[[project]]
title = "Payment Processing API"
base-url = "https://payments.example.com"
workers = 4
```

You can also use environment variable substitution for string values:

```toml
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" }
```

- Stabilized `positive_data_acceptance` and `missing_required_header` checks.

### :bug: Fixed

- **Coverage Phase**: 
    - Do not generate empty path parameters.
    - Skip empty string examples for path parameters.
    - Generate default values if examples are incorrect or inappropriate for their location.
    - Avoid duplicate positive test cases for string & numeric values in some scenarios.
    - Avoid duplicate negative test cases for objects in some scenarios.
    - Internal error caused by generating invalid header values.
    - Internal error on `maxItems` & unsupported `pattern` combination.
    - Incorrect generation mode in generated test cases which caused false positive in `positive_data_acceptance`.
    - Generating strings of incorrect length on certain `pattern` & `maxLength` combinations.
- Do not trigger `positive_data_acceptance` on 5xx responses.
- Support for Hypothesis `>6.131.14`.
- Internal error on CTRL-C when running API probes.

### :wrench: Changed

- Enable all available checks by default.
- Do not fallback to GraphQL loading if schema location ends with `openapi.json` and similar filenames. [#2757](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/2757) 
- **INTERNAL**: Ignore deprecation warnings from `jsonschema`.

### :fire: Removed

- `--experimental` CLI option. All experimental features have been stabilized.
- `--experimental-coverage-unexpected-methods` CLI option. Use `[phases.coverage]` configuration table instead:

```toml
[phases.coverage]
unexpected-methods = ["PATCH"]
```

- `--experimental-missing-required-header-allowed-statuses` CLI option. Use `[checks.missing_required_header]` configuration table instead:

```toml
[checks.missing_required_header]
expected-statuses = [200, 201, 202]
```

- `--experimental-positive-data-acceptance-allowed-statuses` CLI option. Use `[checks.positive_data_acceptance]` configuration table instead:

```toml
[checks.positive_data_acceptance]
expected-statuses = [200, 201, 202]
```

- `--experimental-negative-data-rejection-allowed-statuses` CLI option. Use `[checks.negative_data_rejection]` configuration table instead:

```toml
[checks.negative_data_rejection]
expected-statuses = [200, 201, 202]
```

- `--set-{header,cookie,path,query}` CLI options. Use parameter overrides in the configuration file instead:

```toml
# Global parameters
[parameters]
api_version = "v2"

# Operation-specific parameters
[[operations]]
include-name = "GET /users/"
parameters = { limit = 50, offset = 0 }

[[operations]]
include-name = "GET /users/{user_id}/"
# Disambiguate parameters with the same name
parameters = { "path.user_id" = 42, "query.user_id" = 100 }
```

    as an empty string.

## [4.0.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v4.0.0-alpha.4...v4.0.0-alpha.5) - 2025-02-23

This release introduces a new phase management system for CLI that
simplifies test execution control and separates unit testing into
different stages.

Phase configuration changes:

-   `examples` (formerly `explicit`): Runs examples specified in the API
    schema
-   `fuzzing` (formerly `generate`): Testing with randomly generated
    test cases
-   `coverage`: Deterministic testing of schema constraints and boundary
    values
-   `reuse` and `shrink` remain enabled by default. Disable via
    `--generation-database=none` and `--no-shrink`.
-   `target` phase available via `--generation-maximize=<METRIC>`

**NOTE**: Pytest integration does not currently have a way to disable
the coverage phase. Python API support is planned for future releases.

### :rocket: Added

-   Warning for 4xx-only operations during unit tests to help identify
    configuration issues.

### :wrench: Changed

-   Separate `coverage` and `examples` into independent testing phases.
-   Replace `--hypothesis-phases` with `--phases`.
-   Do not report `unsupported_method` failure if the API returned HTTP
    200 on OPTIONS request.
-   Add HTTP 406 status to the list of status codes that are expected
    for negative test cases.
-   The experimental `--experimental-no-failfast` option has been
    stabilized as `--continue-on-failure`. This option ensures all test
    cases within a scenario are executed, even if failures occur.

### :bug: Fixed

-   **Coverage phase**: Missing test case metadata leading to some
    failures not being detected.
-   **Coverage phase**: Missing parameter overrides.
-   **Coverage phase**: Custom auth implementation not applied to test
    cases.
-   **Coverage phase**: Not applying parameter serialization rules
    during test generation.
-   Incorrect quantifiers merging for some patterns. [#2732](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/2732)
-   Showing `1 errors` instead of `1 error` in CLI output.

### :fire: Removed

-   `--hypothesis-no-phases`.
-   `--exitfirst`. Use `--max-failures=1` instead.

## [4.0.0-alpha.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v4.0.0-alpha.3...v4.0.0-alpha.4) - 2025-02-03

### :rocket: Added

-   `--report` unified reporting system with multiple format support.
-   `--report-dir` for centralized report storage.
-   Display Open API link definition & extraction errors in CLI output.

### :wrench: Changed

-   Rename `--generation-optimize` to `--generation-maximize`
-   Rename `--generation-mode` to `-m/--mode`
-   Rename `--generation-max-examples` to `-n/--max-examples`

    `--no-shrink` option
-   Simplify help messages for filtering options.
-   Add display of selected operations count in CLI.
-   Improve state machine generation by prioritizing reliable API entry
    points over random operations.
-   Make operation filtering independent of API base path for more
    predictable behavior.
-   Improve error message for malformed JSON responses.
-   Return `UNRESOLVABLE` sentinel instead of an empty string when Open
    API runtime expressions can't be evaluated (e.g., when
    `$response.body#/id` is not found)
-   **BREAKING**: The `validate_response` method in state machines now
    accepts the same keyword arguments as `call`. If you've overridden
    this method, update its signature to include `**kwargs`.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Handling of multiple API links pointing to the same operation with
    different parameters.
-   **CLI**: Make exact method filters case-insensitive.
-   Internal error in coverage phase when a parameter mixes keywords for
    different types.
-   Skip irrelevant checks for "Unspecified HTTP method" coverage
    scenarios.
-   Handle `verify=False` properly when specified via `get_call_kwargs`
    on a state machine. [#2713](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/2713)
-   Preserve test data when unit tests are interrupted via CTRL-C.

### :fire: Removed

-   `--cassette-format` (replaced by `--report`).

-   Improve error message in CLI when the schema contains incorrect Open
    API links.
-   Display the number of covered, selected, and total Open API links in
    stateful testing output.
-   Vary random seed in subsequent state machine re-runs to avoid
    repeating all previous sequences.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Handling of complex regex patterns with multiple quantifiers to
    respect length constraints during test generation.
-   Internal error during the coverage phase if negated parameter has no
    `type`.
-   Internal error in CLI if run with `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment
    variable that is not `utf8`.
-   Overriding of multiple incoming links defined for the same status
    code in OpenAPI specification.
-   Support for API links where operations can form a cycle (e.g.,
    DELETE -\> POST -\> DELETE).
-   Incorrect Open API link selection when target operations are
    filtered out.
-   False positive in the `ensure_resource_availability` check.
-   Calculating the number of Open API links selected for testing.

-   Cleaner display of schema loading errors.

### :bug: Fixed

-   More accurate exception deduplication based on source location
    instead of messages.
-   Stricter validation of `--include-*` and `--exclude-*` CLI options.

## [4.0.0a1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.39.6...v4.0.0a1) - 2025-01-15

I'm releasing Schemathesis 4.0.0a1 - the biggest change in the project's
history. I've rewritten major parts of the core engine, Python API, and
pytest integration from scratch to enable features that were impossible
to implement before. While this means removing some functionality
temporarily, it was necessary to clean up four years of accumulated
hacks and create a more solid foundation.

This is an alpha release - expect breaking changes and missing features.
If you're using Schemathesis in production, stick with 3.x for now. The
documentation is outdated, and I'll update it as the new architecture
stabilizes.

I'd really appreciate your feedback at [this GitHub
Discussion](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/discussions/2677) -
it will help shape the path to stable 4.0. A detailed migration guide
and complete changelog will follow.

### :rocket: Added

-   New test phases system with `--phases`
    CLI option to control unit & stateful testing.

### :racing_car: Performance

-   Up to 3x faster test execution.
-   Up to 15x lower memory usage.

### :wrench: Changed

-   Schema loaders reorganized with namespaces:
    -   `schemathesis.from_uri` → `schemathesis.openapi.from_url`
    -   `schemathesis.from_pytest_fixture` →
        `schemathesis.pytest.from_fixture`
-   Response handling: Custom checks now receive Schemathesis'
    `Response` class instead of `requests.Response`.
-   Payload serialization: Decorators per transport replace single class
    implementation.
-   CLI: Updated header & summary style.
-   Sanitization: Direct arguments in
    `schemathesis.sanitization.configure` instead of `Config` instance.

**Renamed CLI Options**

-   `--data-generation-methods` →
    `--generation-mode`
-   `--targets` →
    `--generation-optimize`
-   `--hypothesis-derandomize` →
    `--generation-deterministic`
-   `--hypothesis-database` →
    `--generation-database`
-   `--hypothesis-seed` →

-   `--hypothesis-max-examples` →
    `--generation-max-examples`
-   `--sanitize-output` →
    `--output-sanitize`

    `--store-network-log`, `--pre-run`, `--dry-run`,
    `--contrib-openapi-formats-uuid`, `--validate-schema`.
-   Most loader configuration moved to `schema.configure` method.
-   `add_case` hook.
-   `schemathesis.contrib.unique_data`.
-   Single argument `AuthProvider.get`.
-   `schemathesis.runner.prepare` (use
    `schemathesis.engine.from_schema`).

### :wastebasket: Deprecated

-   The `--contrib-unique-data` CLI option and the corresponding
    `schemathesis.contrib.unique_data` hook. The concept of this feature
    does not fit the core principles of Hypothesis where strategies are
    configurable on a per-example basis but this feature implies
    uniqueness across examples. This leads to cryptic error messages
    about external state and flaky test runs, therefore it will be
    removed in Schemathesis 4.0

-   Generating examples for properties that have deeply nested `$ref`.
-   Generating examples for properties with boolean sub-schemas.
-   Validating responses with boolean sub-schemas on Open API 3.1.
-   `TypeError` on non-string `pattern` values. This could happen on
    values in YAML, such that when not quoted, they are parsed as
    non-strings.
-   Testing examples requiring unsupported payload media types resulted
    in an internal error. These are now correctly reported as errors
-   Internal error on unsupported regular expressions in inside
    properties during example generation.
-   Missing XML definitions when the media type contains options like
    `application/xml; charset=utf-8`.
-   Unhandled timeout while reading the response payload.

### :wrench: Changed

-   **Python**: Cleaner `repr` for GraphQL & Open API schemas.
-   **GraphQL**: Show suggestion when a field is not found in
    `schema["Query"][field_name]`.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Enhance CLI output for schema loading and internal errors, providing
    clearer diagnostics and guidance. [#1781](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1781), [#1517](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1517), [#1472](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1472)

Before:

``` text
Failed to load schema from https://127.0.0.1:6423/openapi.json
You can use `--wait-for-schema=NUM` to wait for a maximum of NUM seconds on the API schema availability.

Error: requests.exceptions.SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=6423): Max retries exceeded with url: /openapi.json (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER] wrong version number (_ssl.c:992)')))

Add this option to your command line parameters to see full tracebacks: --show-errors-tracebacks
```

After:

``` text
Schema Loading Error

    [SSL: WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER] wrong version number

Tip: Bypass SSL verification with `--request-tls-verify=false`.
```

### :wastebasket: Deprecated

-   Defining `AuthProvider.get` with a single `context` argument. The
    support will be removed in Schemathesis `4.0`.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Fixed type hint for `AuthProvider`. [#1776](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1776)
-   Do not skip negative tests if the generated value is `None`.
-   Lack of execution for ASGI events during testing. [#1305](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1305), [#1727](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1727)
-   Confusing error message when trying to load schema from a
    non-existing file. [#1602](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1602)
-   Reflect disabled TLS verification in generated code samples. [#1054](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1054)
-   Generated cURL commands now include the `Content-Type` header, which
    was previously omitted. [#1783](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1783)
-   Improperly serialized headers in
    `SerializedHistoryEntry.case.extra_headers`.

### :racing_car: Performance

-   Optimize event data emission by postponing code sample generation,
    resulting in a `~4%` reduction in the emitted events data size.

### :fire: Removed

-   Unused `SerializedError.example` attribute. It used to be populated
    for flaky errors before they became regular failures.
-   Unused `TestResult.overridden_headers` attribute.

## [3.19.7](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.19.6...v3.19.7) - 2023-09-03

### :bug: Fixed

-   `Unsatisfiable` error for multiple security schemes applied to the
    same API operation and an explicit `Authorization` header. [#1763](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1763)

## [3.19.6](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.19.5...v3.19.6) - 2023-08-14

### :bug: Fixed

-   Broken `--report` CLI argument under `click>=8.1.4`. [#1753](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1753)

## [3.19.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.19.4...v3.19.5) - 2023-06-03

### :bug: Fixed

-   Do not raise `Unsatisfiable` when explicit headers are provided for
    negative tests.
-   Do not raise `Unsatisfiable` when no headers can be negated.

## [3.19.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.19.3...v3.19.4) - 2023-06-03

### :bug: Fixed

-   Improved handling of negative test scenarios by not raising
    `Unsatisfiable` when path parameters cannot be negated but other
    parameters can be negated.

## [3.19.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.19.2...v3.19.3) - 2023-05-25

### :wrench: Changed

-   Support `requests<3`. [#1742](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1742)
-   Bump the minimum supported `Hypothesis` version to `6.31.6` to
    reflect requirement from `hypothesis-jsonschema`.

### :bug: Fixed

-   `HypothesisDeprecationWarning` regarding deprecated
    `HealthCheck.all()`. [#1739](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1739)

## [3.19.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.19.1...v3.19.2) - 2023-05-20

### :rocket: Added

-   You can now provide a tuple of checks to exclude when validating a
    response.

## [3.19.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.19.0...v3.19.1) - 2023-04-26

### :wrench: Changed

-   Support `requests<2.29`.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Passing `params` / `cookies` to `case.call` causing `TypeError`. [#1734](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1734)

### :fire: Removed

-   Direct dependency on `attrs`.

## [3.19.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.18.5...v3.19.0) - 2023-03-22

### :rocket: Added

-   Schemathesis now supports custom authentication mechanisms from the
    `requests` library. You can use
    `schemathesis.auth.set_from_requests` to set up Schemathesis CLI
    with any third-party authentication implementation that works with
    `requests`. [#1700](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1700)

``` python
import schemathesis
from requests_ntlm import HttpNtlmAuth

schemathesis.auth.set_from_requests(HttpNtlmAuth("domain\\username", "password"))
```

-   Ability to apply authentication conditionally to specific API
    operations using a combination of `@schemathesis.auth.apply_to()`
    and `@schemathesis.auth.skip_for()` decorators.

``` python
import schemathesis


# Apply auth only for operations that path starts with `/users/` but not the `POST` method
@schemathesis.auth().apply_to(path_regex="^/users/").skip_for(method="POST")
class MyAuth:
    ...
```

-   Add a convenience mapping-like interface to `OperationDefinition`
    including indexing access, the `get` method, and "in" support.
-   Request throttling via the `--rate-limit` CLI option. [#910](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/910)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Unified Schemathesis custom authentication usage via the
    `schema.auth` decorator, replacing the previous
    `schema.auth.register` and `schema.auth.apply` methods:

``` python
import schemathesis

schema = schemathesis.from_uri("https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json")


# Schema-level auth
# Before: @schema.auth.register()
@schema.auth()
class MyAuth:
    ...


# Test-level auth
# Before: @schema.auth.apply(MyAuth)
@schema.auth(MyAuth)
@schema.parametrize()
def test_api(case):
    ...
```

### :bug: Fixed

-   Handling of query parameters and cookies passed to `case.call` and
    query parameters passed to `case.call_wsgi`. The user-provided
    values are now merged with the data generated by Schemathesis,
    instead of overriding it completely. [#1705](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1705)
-   Parameter definition takes precedence over security schemes with the
    same name.
-   `Unsatisfiable` error when explicit header name passed via CLI
    clashes with the header parameter name. [#1699](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1699)
-   Not using the `port` keyword argument in schema loaders during API
    schema loading. [#1721](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1721)

## [3.18.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.18.4...v3.18.5) - 2023-02-18

### :rocket: Added

-   Support for specifying the path to load hooks from via the
    `SCHEMATHESIS_HOOKS` environment variable.
    `[#1702](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1702)`.

### :wastebasket: Deprecated

-   Use of the `--pre-run` CLI option for loading hooks. Use the
    `SCHEMATHESIS_HOOKS` environment variable instead.

## [3.18.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.18.3...v3.18.4) - 2023-02-16

### :wrench: Changed

-   Support any Werkzeug 2.x in order to allow mitigation of
    [CVE-2023-25577](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323). [#1695](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1695)

## [3.18.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.18.2...v3.18.3) - 2023-02-12

### :rocket: Added

-   `APIStateMachine.run` method to simplify running stateful tests.

### :wrench: Changed

-   Improved quality of generated test sequences by updating state
    machines in Schemathesis to always run a minimum of two steps during
    testing. [#1627](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1627) If you use
    `hypothesis.stateful.run_state_machine_as_test` to run your stateful
    tests, please use the `run` method on your state machine class
    instead. This change requires upgrading `Hypothesis` to at least
    version `6.68.1`.

## [3.18.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.18.1...v3.18.2) - 2023-02-08

### :racing_car: Performance

-   Modify values in-place inside built-in `map` functions as there is
    no need to copy them.
-   Update `hypothesis-jsonschema` to `0.22.1` for up to 30% faster data
    generation in some workflows.

## [3.18.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.18.0...v3.18.1) - 2023-02-06

### :wrench: Changed

-   Stateful testing: Only make stateful requests when stateful data is
    available from another operation. This change significantly reduces
    the number of API calls that likely will fail because of absence of
    stateful data. [#1669](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1669)

### :racing_car: Performance

-   Do not merge component schemas into the currently tested schema if
    they are not referenced by it. Originally all schemas were merged to
    make them visible to `hypothesis-jsonschema`, but they imply
    significant overhead. [#1180](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1180)
-   Use a faster, specialized version of `deepcopy`.

## [3.18.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.17.5...v3.18.0) - 2023-02-01

### :rocket: Added

-   Extra information to VCR cassettes.

-   The `--contrib-unique-data` CLI option that forces Schemathesis to
    generate unique test cases only. This feature is also available as a
    hook in `schemathesis.contrib.unique_data`.

-   A few decorators & functions that provide a simpler API to extend Schemathesis:  
    -   `schemathesis.auth()` for authentication providers;
    -   `schemathesis.check` for checks;
    -   `schemathesis.hook` & `BaseSchema.hook` for hooks;
    -   `schemathesis.serializer` for serializers;
    -   `schemathesis.target` for targets;
    -   `schemathesis.openapi.format` for custom OpenAPI formats.
    -   `schemathesis.graphql.scalar` for GraphQL scalars.

-   Open API: UUID format generation via the
    `schemathesis.contrib.openapi.formats.uuid` extension You could
    enable it via the `--contrib-openapi-formats-uuid` CLI option.

### :wrench: Changed

-   Build: Switch the build backend to [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/).
-   Relax requirements for `attrs`. [#1643](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1643)
-   Avoid occasional empty lines in cassettes.

### :wastebasket: Deprecated

-   `schemathesis.register_check` in favor of `schemathesis.check`.
-   `schemathesis.register_target` in favor of `schemathesis.target`.
-   `schemathesis.register_string_format` in favor of
    `schemathesis.openapi.format`.
-   `schemathesis.graphql.register_scalar` in favor of
    `schemathesis.graphql.scalar`.
-   `schemathesis.auth.register` in favor of `schemathesis.auth`.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Remove recursive references from the last reference resolution
    level. It works on the best effort basis and does not cover all
    possible cases. [#947](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/947)
-   Invalid cassettes when headers contain characters with a special
    meaning in YAML.
-   Properly display flaky deadline errors.
-   Internal error when the `utf8_bom` fixup is used for WSGI apps.
-   Printing header that are set explicitly via `get_call_kwargs` in
    stateful testing. [#828](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/828)
-   Display all explicitly defined headers in the generated cURL
    command.
-   Replace `starlette.testclient.TestClient` with
    `starlette_testclient.TestClient` to keep compatibility with newer
    `starlette` versions. [#1637](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1637)

### :racing_car: Performance

-   Running negative tests filters out less data.
-   Schema loading: Try a faster loader first if an HTTP response or a
    file is expected to be JSON.

## [3.17.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.17.4...v3.17.5) - 2022-11-08

### :rocket: Added

-   Python 3.11 support. [#1632](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1632)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Allow `Werkzeug<=2.2.2`. [#1631](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1631)

## [3.17.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.17.3...v3.17.4) - 2022-10-19

### :bug: Fixed

-   Appending an extra slash to the `/` path. [#1625](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1625)

## [3.17.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.17.2...v3.17.3) - 2022-10-10

### :bug: Fixed

-   Missing `httpx` dependency. [#1614](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1614)

## [3.17.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.17.1...v3.17.2) - 2022-08-27

### :bug: Fixed

-   Insufficient timeout for report uploads.

## [3.17.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.17.0...v3.17.1) - 2022-08-19

### :wrench: Changed

-   Support `requests==2.28.1`.

## [3.17.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.16.5...v3.17.0) - 2022-08-17

### :rocket: Added

-   Support for exception groups in newer `Hypothesis` versions. [#1592](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1592)
-   A way to generate negative and positive test cases within the same
    CLI run via `-D all`.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Allow creating APIs in Schemathesis.io by name when the schema is
    passed as a file.
-   Properly trim tracebacks on `Hypothesis>=6.54.0`.
-   Skipping negative tests when they should not be skipped.

### :wrench: Changed

-   **pytest**: Generate positive & negative within the same test node.
-   **CLI**: Warning if there are too many HTTP 403 API responses.
-   **Runner**: `BeforeExecution.data_generation_method` and
    `AfterExecution.data_generation_method` changed to lists of
    `DataGenerationMethod` as the same test may contain data coming from
    different data generation methods.

## [3.16.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.16.4...v3.16.5) - 2022-08-11

### :bug: Fixed

-   CLI: Hanging on `CTRL-C` when `--report` is enabled.
-   Internal error when GraphQL schema has its root types renamed. [#1591](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1591)

## [3.16.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.16.3...v3.16.4) - 2022-08-09

### :wrench: Changed

-   Suggest using `--wait-for-schema` if API schema is not available.

## [3.16.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.16.2...v3.16.3) - 2022-08-08

### :rocket: Added

-   CLI: `--max-failures=N` option to exit after first `N` failures or
    errors. [#1580](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1580)
-   CLI: `--wait-for-schema=N` option to automatically retry schema
    loading for `N` seconds. [#1582](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1582)
-   CLI: Display old and new payloads in `st replay` when the `-v`
    option is passed. [#1584](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1584)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Internal error on generating negative tests for query parameters
    with `explode: true`.

## [3.16.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.16.1...v3.16.2) - 2022-08-05

### :rocket: Added

-   CLI: Warning if **ALL** API responses are HTTP 404.
-   The `after_load_schema` hook, which is designed for modifying the
    loaded API schema before running tests. For example, you can use it
    to add Open API links to your schema via `schema.add_link`.
-   New `utf8_bom` fixup. It helps to mitigate JSON decoding errors
    inside the `response_schema_conformance` check when payload contains
    BOM. [#1563](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1563)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Description of `-v` or `--verbosity` option for CLI.

### :wrench: Changed

-   Execute `before_call` / `after_call` hooks inside the `call_*`
    methods. It makes them available for the `pytest` integration.

## [3.16.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.16.0...v3.16.1) - 2022-07-29

### :rocket: Added

-   CLI: Warning if the API returns too many HTTP 401.
-   Add `SCHEMATHESIS_BASE_URL` environment variable for specifying
    `--base-url` in CLI.
-   Collect anonymized CLI usage telemetry when reports are uploaded. We
    do not collect any free-form values you use in your CLI, except for
    header names. Instead, we measure how many times you use each
    free-form option in this command. Additionally we count all
    non-default hook types only by hook name.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can disable usage this with the
> `--schemathesis-io-telemetry=false` CLI option or the
> `SCHEMATHESIS_TELEMETRY=false` environment variable.

## [3.16.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.15.6...v3.16.0) - 2022-07-22

### :rocket: Added

-   Report uploading to Schemathesis.io via the `--report` CLI option.

### :wrench: Changed

-   Do not validate schemas by default in the `pytest` integration.
-   CLI: Display test run environment metadata only if `-v` is provided.
-   CLI: Do not display headers automatically added by `requests` in
    code samples.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Do not report optional headers as missing.
-   Compatibility with `hypothesis>=6.49`. [#1538](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1538)
-   Handling of `unittest.case.SkipTest` emitted by newer Hypothesis
    versions.
-   Generating invalid headers when their schema has `array` or `object`
    types.

### :fire: Removed

-   Previously, data was uploaded to Schemathesis.io when the proper
    credentials were specified. This release removes this behavior. From
    now on, every upload requires the explicit `--report` CLI option.
-   Textual representation of HTTP requests in CLI output in order to
    decrease verbosity and avoid showing the same data in multiple
    places.

## [3.15.6](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.15.5...v3.15.6) - 2022-06-23

### :bug: Fixed

-   Do not discard dots (`.`) in OpenAPI expressions during parsing.

## [3.15.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.15.4...v3.15.5) - 2022-06-21

### :bug: Fixed

-   `TypeError` when using `--auth-type=digest` in CLI.

## [3.15.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.15.3...v3.15.4) - 2022-06-06

### :rocket: Added

-   Support generating data for Open API request payloads with wildcard
    media types. [#1526](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1526)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Mark tests as skipped if there are no explicit examples and
    `--hypothesis-phases=explicit` is used. [#1323](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1323)
-   Parse all YAML mapping keys as strings, ignoring the YAML grammar
    rules. For example, `on: true` will be parsed as `{"on": True}`
    instead of `{True: True}`. Even though YAML does not restrict keys
    to strings, in the Open API and JSON Schema context, this
    restriction is implied because the underlying data model comes from
    JSON.
-   **INTERNAL**: Improve flexibility of event serialization.
-   **INTERNAL**: Store request / response history in `SerializedCheck`.

## [3.15.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.15.2...v3.15.3) - 2022-05-28

### :bug: Fixed

-   Deduplication of failures caused by malformed JSON payload. [#1518](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1518)
-   Do not re-raise `InvalidArgument` exception as `InvalidSchema` in
    non-Schemathesis tests. [#1514](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1514)

## [3.15.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.15.1...v3.15.2) - 2022-05-09

### :bug: Fixed

-   Avoid generating negative query samples that `requests` will treat
    as an empty query.
-   Editable installation via `pip`.

## [3.15.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.15.0...v3.15.1) - 2022-05-03

### :rocket: Added

-   **OpenAPI**: Expose `APIOperation.get_security_requirements` that
    returns a list of security requirements applied to the API operation
-   Attach originally failed checks to "grouped" exceptions.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Internal error when Schemathesis doesn't have permission to create
    its `hosts.toml` file.
-   Do not show internal Hypothesis warning multiple times when the
    Hypothesis database directory is not usable.
-   Do not print not relevant Hypothesis reports when run in CI.
-   Invalid `verbose_name` value in `SerializedCase` for GraphQL tests.

## [3.15.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.14.2...v3.15.0) - 2022-05-01

### :rocket: Added

-   **GraphQL**: Mutations supports. Schemathesis will generate random
    mutations by default from now on.
-   **GraphQL**: Support for registering strategies to generate custom
    scalars.
-   Custom auth support for schemas created via `from_pytest_fixture`.

### :wrench: Changed

-   Do not encode payloads in cassettes as base64 by default. This
    change makes Schemathesis match the default Ruby's VCR behavior and
    leads to more human-readable cassettes. Use
    `--cassette-preserve-exact-body-bytes` to restore the old behavior. [#1413](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1413)
-   Bump `hypothesis-graphql` to `0.9.0`.
-   Avoid simultaneous authentication requests inside auth providers
    when caching is enabled.
-   Reduce the verbosity of `pytest` output. A few internal frames and
    the "Falsifying example" block are removed from the output.
-   Skip negative tests on API operations that are not possible to
    negate. [#1463](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1463)
-   Make it possible to generate negative tests if at least one
    parameter can be negated.
-   Treat flaky errors as failures and display full report about the
    failure. [#1081](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1081)
-   Do not duplicate failing explicit example in the
    `HYPOTHESIS OUTPUT` CLI output section. [#881](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/881)

    seconds. If the response is time-outing, Schemathesis will report it
    as a failure. It also solves the case when the tested app hangs. [#1164](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1164)
-   The default test duration deadline is extended to 15 seconds.

## [3.6.11](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.10...v3.6.11) - 2021-05-20

### :rocket: Added

-   Internal: `BeforeExecution.verbose_name` &
    `SerializedCase.verbose_name` that reflect specification-specific
    API operation name.

## [3.6.10](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.9...v3.6.10) - 2021-05-17

### :wrench: Changed

-   Explicitly add `colorama` to project's dependencies.
-   Bump `hypothesis-jsonschema` version.

## [3.6.9](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.8...v3.6.9) - 2021-05-14

### :bug: Fixed

-   Ignored `$ref` keyword in schemas with deeply nested references. [#1167](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1167)
-   Ignored Open API specific keywords & types in schemas with deeply
    nested references. [#1162](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1162)

## [3.6.8](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.7...v3.6.8) - 2021-05-13

### :wrench: Changed

-   Relax dependency on `starlette` to `>=0.13,<1`. [#1160](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1160)

## [3.6.7](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.6...v3.6.7) - 2021-05-12

### :bug: Fixed

-   Missing support for the `date` string format (only `full-date` was
    supported).

## [3.6.6](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.5...v3.6.6) - 2021-05-07

### :wrench: Changed

-   Improve error message for failing Hypothesis deadline healthcheck
    in CLI. [#880](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/880)

## [3.6.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.4...v3.6.5) - 2021-05-07

### :rocket: Added

-   Support for disabling ANSI color escape codes via the
    `NO_COLOR \<https://no-color.org/\>`
    environment variable or the `--no-color` CLI option. [#1153](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1153)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Generate valid header values for Bearer auth by construction rather
    than by filtering.

## [3.6.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.3...v3.6.4) - 2021-04-30

### :wrench: Changed

-   Bump minimum `hypothesis-graphql` version to `0.5.0`. It brings
    support for interfaces and unions and fixes a couple of bugs in
    query generation.

## [3.6.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.2...v3.6.3) - 2021-04-20

### :bug: Fixed

-   Bump minimum `hypothesis-graphql` version to `0.4.1`. It fixes [a
    problem](https://github.com/Stranger6667/hypothesis-graphql/issues/30)
    with generating queries with surrogate characters.
-   `UnicodeEncodeError` when sending `application/octet-stream`
    payloads that have no `format: binary` in their schemas. [#1134](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1134)

## [3.6.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.1...v3.6.2) - 2021-04-15

### :bug: Fixed

-   Windows: `UnicodeDecodeError` during schema loading via the
    `from_path` loader if it contains certain Unicode symbols.
    `from_path` loader defaults to `UTF-8`
    from now on.

## [3.6.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.6.0...v3.6.1) - 2021-04-09

### :bug: Fixed

-   Using parametrized `pytest` fixtures with the `from_pytest_fixture`
    loader. [#1121](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1121)

## [3.6.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.5.3...v3.6.0) - 2021-04-04

### :rocket: Added

-   Custom keyword arguments to `schemathesis.graphql.from_url` that are
    proxied to `requests.post`.
-   `from_wsgi`, `from_asgi`, `from_path` and `from_file` loaders for
    GraphQL apps. [#1097](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1097), [#1100](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1100)
-   Support for `data_generation_methods` and `code_sample_style` in all
    GraphQL loaders.
-   Support for `app` & `base_url` arguments for the
    `from_pytest_fixture` runner.
-   Initial support for GraphQL schemas in the Schemathesis runner.

``` python
import schemathesis

# Load schema
schema = schemathesis.graphql.from_url("http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql")
# Initialize runner
runner = schemathesis.runner.from_schema(schema)
# Emit events
for event in runner.execute():
    ...
```

**Breaking**

-   Loaders' signatures are unified. Most of the arguments became
    keyword-only. All except the first two for ASGI/WSGI, all except the
    first one for the others. It forces loader calls to be more
    consistent.

``` python
# BEFORE
schema = schemathesis.from_uri(
    "http://example.com/openapi.json", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/", "GET"
)
# NOW
schema = schemathesis.from_uri(
    "http://example.com/openapi.json", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/", method="GET"
)
```

### :wrench: Changed

-   Schemathesis generates separate tests for each field defined in the
    GraphQL `Query` type. It makes the testing process unified for both
    Open API and GraphQL schemas.
-   IDs for GraphQL tests use the corresponding `Query` field instead of
    HTTP method & path.
-   Do not show overly verbose raw schemas in Hypothesis output for
    failed GraphQL tests.
-   The `schemathesis.graphql.from_url` loader now uses the usual
    Schemathesis User-Agent.
-   The Hypothesis database now uses separate entries for each API
    operation when executed via CLI. It increases its effectiveness when
    tests are re-run.
-   Module `schemathesis.loaders` is moved to
    `schemathesis.specs.openapi.loaders`.
-   Show a more specific exception on incorrect usage of the `from_path`
    loader in the Schemathesis runner.

### :wastebasket: Deprecated

-   `schemathesis.runner.prepare` will be removed in Schemathesis 4.0.
    Use `schemathesis.runner.from_schema` instead. With this change, the
    schema loading part goes to your code, similar to using the regular
    Schemathesis Python API. It leads to a unified user experience where
    the starting point is API schema loading, which is much clearer than
    passing a callback & keyword arguments to the `prepare` function.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Add the missing `@schema.given` implementation for schemas created
    via the `from_pytest_fixture` loader. [#1093](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1093)
-   Silently ignoring some incorrect usages of `@schema.given`.
-   Fixups examples were using the incorrect fixup name.
-   Return type of `make_case` for GraphQL schemas.
-   Missed `operation_id` argument in `from_asgi` loader.

### :fire: Removed

-   Undocumented way to install fixups via the `fixups` argument for
    `schemathesis.runner.prepare` is removed.

## [3.5.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.5.2...v3.5.3) - 2021-03-27

### :bug: Fixed

-   Do not use `importlib-metadata==3.8` in
    dependencies as it causes `RuntimeError`. Ref:
    <https://github.com/python/importlib_metadata/issues/293>

## [3.5.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.5.1...v3.5.2) - 2021-03-24

### :wrench: Changed

-   Prefix worker thread names with `schemathesis_`.

## [3.5.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.5.0...v3.5.1) - 2021-03-23

### :bug: Fixed

-   Encoding for response payloads displayed in the CLI output. [#1073](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1073)
-   Use actual charset (from `flask.Response.mimetype_params`) when
    storing WSGI responses rather than defaulting to
    `flask.Response.charset`.

## [3.5.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.4.1...v3.5.0) - 2021-03-22

### :rocket: Added

-   `before_generate_case` hook, that allows the user to modify or
    filter generated `Case` instances. [#1067](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1067)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Missing `body` parameters during Open API links processing in CLI. [#1069](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1069)
-   Output types for evaluation results of `$response.body` and
    `$request.body` runtime expressions. [#1068](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1068)

## [3.4.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.4.0...v3.4.1) - 2021-03-21

### :rocket: Added

-   `event_type` field to the debug output.

## [3.4.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.3.1...v3.4.0) - 2021-03-20

### :rocket: Added

-   `--debug-output-file` CLI option to enable storing the underlying
    runner events in the JSON Lines format in a separate file for
    debugging purposes. [#1059](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1059)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Make `Request.body`, `Response.body` and `Response.encoding`
    internal attributes optional. For `Request`, it means that absent
    body will lead to `Request.body` to be `None`. For `Response`,
    `body` will be `None` if the app response did not have any payload.
    Previously these values were empty strings, which was not
    distinguishable from the cases described above. For the end-user, it
    means that in VCR cassettes, fields `request.body` and
    `response.body` may be absent.
-   `models.Status` enum now has string values for more readable
    representation.

## [3.3.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.3.0...v3.3.1) - 2021-03-18

### :bug: Fixed

-   Displaying wrong headers in the `FAILURES` block of the CLI output. [#792](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/792)

## [3.3.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.2.2...v3.3.0) - 2021-03-17

### :rocket: Added

-   Display failing response payload in the CLI output, similarly to the
    pytest plugin output. [#1050](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1050)
-   A way to control which code sample style to use - Python or cURL. [#908](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/908)

### :bug: Fixed

-   `UnicodeDecodeError` when generating cURL commands for failed test
    case reproduction if the request's body contains non-UTF8
    characters.

**Internal**

-   Extra information to events, emitted by the Schemathesis runner.

## [3.2.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.2.1...v3.2.2) - 2021-03-11

### :rocket: Added

-   Support for Hypothesis 6. [#1013](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1013)

## [3.2.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.2.0...v3.2.1) - 2021-03-10

### :bug: Fixed

-   Wrong test results in some cases when the tested schema contains a
    media type that Schemathesis doesn't know how to work with. [#1046](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1046)

## [3.2.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.1.3...v3.2.0) - 2021-03-09

### :racing_car: Performance

-   Add an internal caching layer for data generation strategies. It
    relies on the fact that the internal `BaseSchema` structure is not
    mutated over time. It is not directly possible through the public
    API and is discouraged from doing through hook functions.

### :wrench: Changed

-   `APIOperation` and subclasses of `Parameter` are now compared by
    their identity rather than by value.

## [3.1.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.1.2...v3.1.3) - 2021-03-08

### :rocket: Added

-   `count_operations` boolean flag to `runner.prepare`. In case of
    `False` value, Schemathesis won't count the total number of
    operations upfront. It improves performance for the direct `runner`
    usage, especially on large schemas. Schemathesis CLI will still use
    these calculations to display the progress during execution, but
    this behavior may become configurable in the future.

## [3.1.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.1.1...v3.1.2) - 2021-03-08

### :bug: Fixed

-   Percent-encode the generated `.` and `..` strings in path parameters
    to avoid resolving relative paths and changing the tested path
    structure. [#1036](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1036)

## [3.1.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.1.0...v3.1.1) - 2021-03-05

### :bug: Fixed

-   Loosen `importlib-metadata` version constraint and update `pyproject.toml`. [#1039](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1039)

## [3.1.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.0.9...v3.1.0) - 2021-02-11

### :rocket: Added

-   Support for external examples via the `externalValue` keyword. [#884](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/884)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Prevent a small terminal width causing a crash (due to negative
    length used in an f-string) when printing percentage
-   Support the latest `cryptography` version in Docker images. [#1033](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1033)

## [3.0.9](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.0.8...v3.0.9) - 2021-02-10

### :bug: Fixed

-   Return a default terminal size to prevent crashes on systems with
    zero-width terminals (some CI/CD servers).

## [3.0.8](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.0.7...v3.0.8) - 2021-02-04

-   This release updates the documentation to be in-line with the
    current state.

## [3.0.7](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.0.6...v3.0.7) - 2021-01-31

### :bug: Fixed

-   Docker tags for Buster-based images.

## [3.0.6](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.0.5...v3.0.6) - 2021-01-31

-   Packaging-only release for Docker images based on Debian Buster. [#1028](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1028)

## [3.0.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.0.4...v3.0.5) - 2021-01-30

### :bug: Fixed

-   Allow to use any iterable type for `checks` and `additional_checks`
    arguments to `Case.validate_response`.

## [3.0.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.0.3...v3.0.4) - 2021-01-19

### :bug: Fixed

-   Generating stateful tests, with common parameters behind a
    reference. [#1020](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1020)
-   Programmatic addition of Open API links via `add_link` when schema
    validation is disabled and response status codes are noted as
    integers. [#1022](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1022)

### :wrench: Changed

-   When operations are resolved by `operationId` then the same
    reference resolving logic is applied as in other cases. This change
    leads to less reference inlining and lower memory consumption for
    deeply nested schemas. [#945](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/945)

## [3.0.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.0.2...v3.0.3) - 2021-01-18

### :bug: Fixed

-   `Flaky` Hypothesis error during explicit examples generation. [#1018](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1018)

## [3.0.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.0.1...v3.0.2) - 2021-01-15

### :bug: Fixed

-   Processing parameters common for multiple API operations if they are
    behind a reference. [#1015](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1015)

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1) - 2021-01-15

### :rocket: Added

-   YAML serialization for `text/yaml`, `text/x-yaml`,
    `application/x-yaml` and `text/vnd.yaml` media types. [#1010](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1010).

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.8.6...v3.0.0) - 2021-01-14

### :rocket: Added

-   Support for sending `text/plain` payload as test data. Including
    variants with non-default `charset`. [#850](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/850), [#939](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/939)
-   Generating data for all media types defined for an operation. [#690](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/690)
-   Support for user-defined media types serialization. You can define
    how Schemathesis should handle media types defined in your schema or
    customize existing (like `application/json`).
-   The `response_schema_conformance` check
    now runs on media types that are encoded with JSON. For example,
    `application/problem+json`. [#920](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/920)
-   Base URL for GraphQL schemas. It allows you to load the schema from
    one place but send test requests to another one. [#934](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/934)
-   A helpful error message when an operation is not found during the
    direct schema access. [#812](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/812)
-   `--dry-run` CLI option. When applied, Schemathesis won't send any
    data to the server and won't perform any response checks. [#963](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/963)
-   A better error message when the API schema contains an invalid
    regular expression syntax. [#1003](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1003)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Open API parameters parsing to unblock supporting multiple media
    types per operation. Their definitions aren't converted to JSON
    Schema equivalents right away but deferred instead and stored as-is.
-   Missing `required: true` in path parameters definition is now
    automatically enforced if schema validation is disabled. According
    to the Open API spec, the `required` keyword value should be `true`
    for path parameters. This change allows Schemathesis to generate
    test cases even for endpoints containing optional path parameters
    (which is not compliant with the spec). [#941](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/941)
-   Using `--auth` together with `--header` that sets the
    `Authorization` header causes a validation error. Before, the
    `--header` value was ignored in such cases, and the basic auth
    passed in `--auth` was used. [#911](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/911)
-   When `hypothesis-jsonschema` fails to resolve recursive references,
    the test is skipped with an error message that indicates why it
    happens.
-   Shorter error messages when API operations have logical errors in
    their schema. For example, when the maximum is less than the
    minimum - `{"type": "integer", "minimum": 5, "maximum": 4}`.
-   If multiple non-check related failures happens during a test of a
    single API operation, they are displayed as is, instead of
    Hypothesis-level error messages about multiple found failures or
    flaky tests. [#975](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/975)
-   Catch schema parsing errors, that are caused by YAML parsing.
-   The built-in test server now accepts `--operations` instead of
    `--endpoints`.
-   Display `Collected API operations` instead of `collected endpoints`
    in the CLI. [#869](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/869)
-   `--skip-deprecated-endpoints` is renamed to
    `--skip-deprecated-operations`. [#869](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/869)
-   Rename various internal API methods that contained `endpoint` in
    their names. [#869](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/869)
-   Bump `hypothesis-jsonschema` version to `0.19.0`. This version
    improves the handling of unsupported regular expression syntax and
    can generate data for a subset of schemas containing such regular
    expressions.
-   Schemathesis doesn't stop testing on errors during schema parsing.
    These errors are handled the same way as other errors during the
    testing process. It allows Schemathesis to test API operations with
    valid definitions and report problematic operations instead of
    failing the whole run. [#999](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/999)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Allow generating requests without payload if the schema does not
    require it. [#916](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/916)
-   Allow sending `null` as request payload if the schema expects it. [#919](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/919)
-   CLI failure if the tested operation is
    `GET` and has payload examples. [#925](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/925)
-   Excessive reference inlining that leads to out-of-memory for large
    schemas with deep references. [#945](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/945), [#671](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/671)
-   `--exitfirst` CLI option trims the progress bar output when a
    failure occurs. [#951](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/951)
-   Internal error if filling missing explicit examples led to
    `Unsatisfiable` errors. [#904](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/904)
-   Do not suggest to disable schema validation if it is already
    disabled. [#914](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/914)
-   Skip explicit examples generation if this phase is disabled via
    config. [#905](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/905)
-   `Unsatisfiable` error in stateful testing caused by all API
    operations having inbound links. [#965](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/965), [#822](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/822)
-   A possibility to override `APIStateMachine.step`. [#970](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/970)
-   `TypeError` on nullable parameters during Open API specific
    serialization. [#980](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/980)
-   Invalid types in `x-examples`. [#982](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/982)
-   CLI crash on schemas with operation names longer than the current
    terminal width. [#990](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/990)
-   Handling of API operations that contain reserved characters in their
    paths. [#992](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/992)
-   CLI execution stops on errors during example generation. [#994](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/994)
-   Fill missing properties in incomplete explicit examples for non-body
    parameters. [#1007](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/1007)

### :wastebasket: Deprecated

-   `HookContext.endpoint`. Use `HookContext.operation` instead.
-   `Case.endpoint`. Use `Case.operation` instead.

### :racing_car: Performance

-   Use compiled versions of Open API spec validators.
-   Decrease CLI memory usage. [#987](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/987)
-   Various improvements relevant to processing of API operation
    definitions. It gives ~20% improvement on large schemas with many
    references.

### :fire: Removed

-   `Case.form_data`. Use `Case.body` instead.
-   `Endpoint.form_data`. Use `Endpoint.body` instead.
-   `before_generate_form_data` hook. Use `before_generate_body`
    instead.
-   Deprecated stateful testing integration from our `pytest` plugin.

> [!NOTE]
> This release features multiple backward-incompatible changes. The
> first one is removing `form_data` and hooks related to it -all payload
> related actions can be done via `body` and its hooks. The second one
> involves renaming the so-called "endpoint" to "operation". The main
> reason for this is to generalize terminology and make it applicable to
> GraphQL schemas, as all Schemathesis internals are more suited to work
> with semantically different API operations rather than with endpoints
> that are often connected with URLs and HTTP methods. It brings the
> possibility to reuse the same concepts for Open API and GraphQL - in
> the future, unit tests will cover individual API operations in
> GraphQL, rather than everything available under the same "endpoint".

### :rocket: Added

-   `auto` variant for the `--workers` CLI option that automatically
    detects the number of available CPU cores to run tests on. [#917](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/917)

## [2.8.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.8.3...v2.8.4) - 2020-11-27

### :bug: Fixed

-   Use `--request-tls-verify` during schema loading as well. [#897](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/897)

## [2.8.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.8.2...v2.8.3) - 2020-11-27

### :rocket: Added

-   Display failed response payload in the error output for the `pytest`
    plugin. [#895](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/895)

### :wrench: Changed

-   In pytest plugin output, Schemathesis error classes use the
    `CheckFailed` name. Before, they had
    not readable "internal" names.
-   Hypothesis falsifying examples. The code does not include `Case`
    attributes with default values to improve readability. [#886](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/886)

## [2.8.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.8.1...v2.8.2) - 2020-11-25

### :bug: Fixed

-   Internal error in CLI, when the `base_url` is an invalid IPv6. [#890](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/890)
-   Internal error in CLI, when a malformed regex is passed to `-E` /
    `-M` / `-T` / `-O` CLI options. [#889](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/889)

## [2.8.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.8.0...v2.8.1) - 2020-11-24

### :rocket: Added

-   `--force-schema-version` CLI option to force Schemathesis to use the
    specific Open API spec version when parsing the schema. [#876](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/876)

### :wrench: Changed

-   The `content_type_conformance` check now raises a well-formed error
    message when encounters a malformed media type value. [#877](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/877)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Internal error during verifying explicit examples if an example has
    no `value` key. [#882](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/882)

## [2.8.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.7.7...v2.8.0) - 2020-11-24

### :rocket: Added

-   `--request-tls-verify` CLI option, that controls whether
    Schemathesis verifies the server's TLS certificate. You can also
    pass the path to a CA_BUNDLE file for private certs. [#830](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/830)

### :wrench: Changed

-   In CLI, if an endpoint contains an invalid schema, show a message
    about the `--validate-schema` CLI option. [#855](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/855)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Handling of 204 responses in the `response_schema_conformance`
    check. Before, all responses were required to have the
    `Content-Type` header. [#844](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/844)
-   Catch `OverflowError` when an invalid regex is passed to `-E` / `-M`
    / `-T` / `-O` CLI options. [#870](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/870)
-   Internal error in CLI, when the schema location is an invalid IPv6. [#872](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/872)
-   Collecting Open API links behind references via CLI. [#874](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/874)

### :wastebasket: Deprecated

-   Using of `Case.form_data` and `Endpoint.form_data`. In the `3.0`
    release, you'll need to use relevant `body` attributes instead. This
    change includes deprecation of the `before_generate_form_data` hook,
    use `before_generate_body` instead. The reason for this is the
    upcoming unification of parameter handling and their serialization.
-   `--stateful-recursion-limit`. It will be removed in `3.0` as a part
    of removing the old stateful testing approach. This parameter is
    no-op.

## [2.7.7](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.7.6...v2.7.7) - 2020-11-13

### :bug: Fixed

-   Missed `headers` in `Endpoint.partial_deepcopy`.

## [2.7.6](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.7.5...v2.7.6) - 2020-11-12

### :rocket: Added

-   An option to set data generation methods. At the moment, it includes
    only "positive", which means that Schemathesis will generate data
    that matches the schema.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Pinned dependency on `attrs` that caused an error on fresh
    installations. [#858](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/858)

## [2.7.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.7.4...v2.7.5) - 2020-11-09

### :bug: Fixed

-   Invalid keyword in code samples that Schemathesis suggests to run to
    reproduce errors. [#851](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/851)

## [2.7.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.7.3...v2.7.4) - 2020-11-07

### :rocket: Added

-   New `relative_path` property for `BeforeExecution` and
    `AfterExecution` events. It represents an operation path as it is in
    the schema definition.

## [2.7.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.7.2...v2.7.3) - 2020-11-05

### :bug: Fixed

-   Internal error on malformed JSON when the `response_conformance`
    check is used. [#832](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/832)

## [2.7.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.7.1...v2.7.2) - 2020-11-05

### :rocket: Added

-   Shortcut for response validation when Schemathesis's data generation
    is not used. [#485](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/485)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Improve the error message when the application can not be loaded
    from the value passed to the `--app` command-line option. [#836](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/836)
-   Security definitions are now serialized as other parameters. At the
    moment, it means that the generated values will be coerced to
    strings, which is a no-op. However, types of security definitions
    might be affected by the "Negative testing" feature in the future.
    Therefore this change is mostly for future-compatibility. [#841](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/841)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Internal error when a "header" / "cookie" parameter were not coerced
    to a string before filtration. [#839](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/839)

## [2.7.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.7.0...v2.7.1) - 2020-10-22

### :bug: Fixed

-   Adding new Open API links via the `add_link` method, when the
    related PathItem contains a reference. [#824](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/824)

## [2.7.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.6.1...v2.7.0) - 2020-10-21

### :rocket: Added

-   New approach to stateful testing, based on the Hypothesis's
    `RuleBasedStateMachine`. [#737](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/737)
-   `Case.validate_response` accepts the new `additional_checks`
    argument. It provides a way to execute additional checks in addition
    to existing ones.

### :wrench: Changed

-   The `response_schema_conformance` and `content_type_conformance`
    checks fail unconditionally if the input response has no
    `Content-Type` header. [#816](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/816)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Failure reproduction code missing values that were explicitly passed
    to `call_*` methods during testing. [#814](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/814)

### :wastebasket: Deprecated

-   Using `stateful=Stateful.links` in schema loaders and `parametrize`.
    Use `schema.as_state_machine().TestCase` instead. The old approach
    to stateful testing will be removed in `3.0`. See the
    `Stateful testing` section of our documentation for more
    information.

## [2.6.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.6.0...v2.6.1) - 2020-10-19

### :rocket: Added

-   New method `as_curl_command` added to the `Case` class. [#689](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/689)

## [2.6.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0) - 2020-10-06

### :rocket: Added

-   Support for passing Hypothesis strategies to tests created with
    `schema.parametrize` by using `schema.given` decorator. [#768](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/768)
-   Support for PEP561. [#748](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/748)
-   Shortcut for calling & validation. [#738](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/738)
-   New hook to pre-commit, `rstcheck`, as well as updates to
    documentation based on rstcheck. [#734](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/734)
-   New check for maximum response time and corresponding CLI option
    `--max-response-time`. [#716](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/716)
-   New `response_headers_conformance` check that verifies the presence
    of all headers defined for a response. [#742](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/742)
-   New field with information about executed checks in cassettes. [#702](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/702)
-   New `port` parameter added to `from_uri()` method. [#706](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/706)
-   A code snippet to reproduce a failed check when running Python
    tests. [#793](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/793)
-   Python 3.9 support. [#731](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/731)
-   Ability to skip deprecated endpoints with
    `--skip-deprecated-endpoints` CLI option and
    `skip_deprecated_operations=True` argument to schema loaders. [#715](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/715)

### :bug: Fixed

-   `User-Agent` header overriding the passed one. [#757](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/757)
-   Default `User-Agent` header in `Case.call`. [#717](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/717)
-   Status of individual interactions in VCR cassettes. Before this
    change, all statuses were taken from the overall test outcome,
    rather than from the check results for a particular response. [#695](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/695)
-   Escaping header values in VCR cassettes. [#783](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/783)
-   Escaping HTTP response message in VCR cassettes. [#788](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/788)

### :wrench: Changed

-   `Case.as_requests_kwargs` and `Case.as_werkzeug_kwargs` now return
    the `User-Agent` header. This change also affects code snippets for
    failure reproduction - all snippets will include the `User-Agent`
    header.

### :racing_car: Performance

-   Speed up generation of `headers`, `cookies`, and `formData`
    parameters when their schemas do not define the `type` keyword. [#795](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/795)

## [2.5.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.5.0...v2.5.1) - 2020-09-30

This release contains only documentation updates which are necessary to
upload to PyPI.

## [2.5.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.4.1...v2.5.0) - 2020-09-27

### :rocket: Added

-   Stateful testing via Open API links for the `pytest` runner. [#616](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/616)
-   Support for GraphQL tests for the `pytest` runner. [#649](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/649)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Progress percentage in the terminal output for "lazy" schemas. [#636](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/636)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Check name is no longer displayed in the CLI output, since its
    verbose message is already displayed. This change also simplifies
    the internal structure of the runner events.
-   The `stateful` argument type in the `runner.prepare` is
    `Optional[Stateful]` instead of `Optional[str]`. Use
    `schemathesis.Stateful` enum.

## [2.4.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.4.0...v2.4.1) - 2020-09-17

### :wrench: Changed

-   Hide `Case.endpoint` from representation. Its representation
    decreases the usability of the pytest's output. [#719](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/719)
-   Return registered functions from `register_target` and
    `register_check` decorators. [#721](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/721)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Possible `IndexError` when a user-defined check raises an exception
    without a message. [#718](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/718)

## [2.4.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.3.4...v2.4.0) - 2020-09-15

### :rocket: Added

-   Ability to register custom targets for targeted testing. [#686](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/686)

### :wrench: Changed

-   The `AfterExecution` event now has `path` and `method` fields,
    similar to the `BeforeExecution` one. The goal is to make these
    events self-contained, which improves their usability.

## [2.3.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.3.3...v2.3.4) - 2020-09-11

### :wrench: Changed

-   The default Hypothesis's `deadline` setting for tests with
    `schema.parametrize` is set to 500 ms for consistency with the CLI
    behavior. [#705](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/705)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Encoding error when writing a cassette on Windows. [#708](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/708)

## [2.3.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.3.2...v2.3.3) - 2020-08-04

### :bug: Fixed

-   `KeyError` during the `content_type_conformance` check if the
    response has no `Content-Type` header. [#692](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/692)

## [2.3.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.3.1...v2.3.2) - 2020-08-04

### :rocket: Added

-   Run checks conditionally.

## [2.3.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.3.0...v2.3.1) - 2020-07-28

### :bug: Fixed

-   `IndexError` when `examples` list is empty.

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.2.1...v2.3.0) - 2020-07-26

### :rocket: Added

-   Possibility to generate values for `in: formData` parameters that
    are non-bytes or contain non-bytes (e.g., inside an array). [#665](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/665)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Error message for cases when a path parameter is in the template but
    is not defined in the parameters list or missing `required: true` in
    its definition. [#667](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/667)
-   Bump minimum required `hypothesis-jsonschema` version to
    `0.17.0`. This allows Schemathesis to
    use the `custom_formats` argument in `from_schema` calls and avoid
    using its private API. [#684](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/684)

### :bug: Fixed

-   `ValueError` during sending a request with test payload if the
    endpoint defines a parameter with `type: array` and `in: formData`. [#661](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/661)
-   `KeyError` while processing a schema with nullable parameters and
    `in: body`. [#660](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/660)
-   `StopIteration` during `requestBody` processing if it has empty
    "content" value. [#673](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/673)
-   `AttributeError` during generation of "multipart/form-data"
    parameters that have no "type" defined. [#675](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/675)
-   Support for properties named "$ref" in object schemas. Previously,
    it was causing `TypeError`. [#672](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/672)
-   Generating illegal Unicode surrogates in the path. [#668](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/668)
-   Invalid development dependency on `graphql-server-core` package. [#658](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/658)

## [2.2.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1) - 2020-07-22

### :bug: Fixed

-   Possible `UnicodeEncodeError` during generation of `Authorization`
    header values for endpoints with `basic` security scheme. [#656](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/656)

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0) - 2020-07-14

### :rocket: Added

-   `schemathesis.graphql.from_dict` loader allows you to use GraphQL
    schemas represented as a dictionary for testing.
-   `before_load_schema` hook for GraphQL schemas.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Serialization of non-string parameters. [#651](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/651)

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0) - 2020-07-06

### :rocket: Added

-   Support for property-level examples. [#467](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/467)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Content-type conformance check for cases when Open API 3.0 schemas
    contain "default" response definitions. [#641](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/641)
-   Handling of multipart requests for Open API 3.0 schemas. [#640](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/640)
-   Sending non-file form fields in multipart requests. [#647](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/647)

### :fire: Removed

-   Deprecated `skip_validation` argument to `HookDispatcher.apply`.
-   Deprecated `_accepts_context` internal function.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.10.0...v2.0.0) - 2020-07-01

### :wrench: Changed

-   **BREAKING**. Base URL handling. `base_url` now is treated as one
    with a base path included. You should pass a full base URL now
    instead:

``` bash
schemathesis run --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v2 ...
```

This value will override `basePath` / `servers[0].url` defined in your
schema if you use Open API 2.0 / 3.0 respectively. Previously if you
pass a base URL like the one above, it was concatenated with the base
path defined in the schema, which leads to a lack of ability to redefine
the base path. [#511](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/511)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Show the correct URL in CLI progress when the base URL is
    overridden, including the path part. [#511](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/511)
-   Construct valid URL when overriding base URL with base path. [#511](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/511)

**Example**:

``` bash
Base URL in the schema         : http://0.0.0.0:8081/api/v1
`--base-url` value in CLI      : http://0.0.0.0:8081/api/v2
Full URLs before this change   : http://0.0.0.0:8081/api/v2/api/v1/users/  # INVALID!
Full URLs after this change    : http://0.0.0.0:8081/api/v2/users/         # VALID!
```

### :fire: Removed

-   Support for hooks without `context`
    argument in the first position.
-   Hooks registration by name and function. Use `register` decorators
    instead. For more details, see the "Customization" section in our
    documentation.
-   `BaseSchema.with_hook` and `BaseSchema.register_hook`. Use
    `BaseSchema.hooks.apply` and `BaseSchema.hooks.register` instead.

## [1.10.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.9.1...v1.10.0) - 2020-06-28

### :rocket: Added

-   `loaders.from_asgi` supports making calls to ASGI-compliant
    application (For example: FastAPI). [#521](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/521)
-   Support for GraphQL strategies.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Passing custom headers to schema loader for WSGI / ASGI apps. [#631](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/631)

## [1.9.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.9.0...v1.9.1) - 2020-06-21

### :bug: Fixed

-   Schema validation error on schemas containing numeric values in
    scientific notation without a dot. [#629](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/629)

## [1.9.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.8.0...v1.9.0) - 2020-06-20

### :rocket: Added

-   Pass the original case's response to the `add_case` hook.
-   Support for multiple examples with OpenAPI `examples`. [#589](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/589)
-   `--verbosity` CLI option to minimize the error output. [#598](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/598)
-   Allow registering function-level hooks without passing their name as
    the first argument to `apply`. [#618](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/618)
-   Support for hook usage via `LazySchema` / `from_pytest_fixture`. [#617](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/617)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Tests with invalid schemas marked as errors, instead of failures. [#622](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/622)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Crash during the generation of loosely-defined headers. [#621](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/621)
-   Show exception information for test runs on invalid schemas with
    `--validate-schema=false` command-line option. Before, the output
    sections for invalid endpoints were empty. [#622](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/622)

## [1.8.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0) - 2020-06-15

### :bug: Fixed

-   Tests with invalid schemas are marked as failed instead of passed
    when `hypothesis-jsonschema>=0.16` is installed. [#614](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/614)
-   `KeyError` during creating an endpoint strategy if it contains a
    reference. [#612](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/612)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Require `hypothesis-jsonschema>=0.16`. [#614](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/614)

-   Support serializing parameters with `application/json` content-type. [#594](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/594)

### :wrench: Changed

-   The minimum required versions for `Hypothesis` and
    `hypothesis-jsonschema` are `5.15.0` and `0.11.1` respectively. The
    main reason is [this
    fix](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/commit/4c7f3fbc55b294f13a503b2d2af0d3221fd37938)
    that is required for stability of Open API links feature when it is
    executed in multiple threads.

## [1.6.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.6.2...v1.6.3) - 2020-05-26

## [1.6.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.6.1...v1.6.2) - 2020-05-15

### :bug: Fixed

-   Partially generated explicit examples are always valid and can be
    used in requests. [#582](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/582)

## [1.6.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.6.0...v1.6.1) - 2020-05-13

### :wrench: Changed

-   Look at the current working directory when loading hooks for CLI. [#586](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/586)

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.5.1...v1.6.0) - 2020-05-10

### :rocket: Added

-   New `before_add_examples` hook. [#571](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/571)
-   New `after_init_cli_run_handlers` hook. [#575](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/575)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Passing `workers_num` to `ThreadPoolRunner` leads to always using 2
    workers in this worker kind. [#579](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/579)

## [1.5.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.5.0...v1.5.1) - 2020-05-08

### :bug: Fixed

-   Display proper headers in reproduction code when headers are
    overridden. [#566](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/566)

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.4.0...v1.5.0) - 2020-05-06

### :rocket: Added

-   Display a suggestion to disable schema validation on schema loading
    errors in CLI. [#531](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/531)
-   Filtration of endpoints by `operationId` via `operation_id`
    parameter to `schema.parametrize` or `-O` command-line option. [#546](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/546)
-   Generation of security-related parameters. They are taken from
    `securityDefinitions` / `securitySchemes` and injected to the
    generated data. It supports generating API keys in headers or query
    parameters and generating data for HTTP authentication schemes. [#540](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/540)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Overriding header values in CLI and runner when headers provided
    explicitly clash with ones defined in the schema. [#559](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/559)
-   Nested references resolving in `response_schema_conformance` check. [#562](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/562)
-   Nullable parameters handling when they are behind a reference. [#542](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/542)

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.3.4...v1.4.0) - 2020-05-03

### :rocket: Added

-   `context` argument for hook functions to provide an additional
    context for hooks. A deprecation warning is emitted for hook
    functions that do not accept this argument.
-   A new hook system that allows generic hook dispatching. It comes
    with new hook locations. For more details, see the "Customization"
    section in our documentation.
-   New `before_process_path` hook.
-   Third-party compatibility fixups mechanism. Currently, there is one
    fixup for [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi). [#503](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/503)

Deprecated

-   Hook functions that do not accept `context` as their first argument.
    They will become not be supported in Schemathesis 2.0.
-   Registering hooks by name and function. Use `register` decorators
    instead. For more details, see the "Customization" section in our
    documentation.
-   `BaseSchema.with_hook` and `BaseSchema.register_hook`. Use
    `BaseSchema.hooks.apply` and `BaseSchema.hooks.register` instead.

### :bug: Fixed

-   Add missing `validate_schema` argument to
    `loaders.from_pytest_fixture`.
-   Reference resolving during response schema conformance check. [#539](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/539)

## [1.3.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.3.3...v1.3.4) - 2020-04-30

### :bug: Fixed

-   Validation of nullable properties in `response_schema_conformance`
    check introduced in `1.3.0`. [#542](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/542)

## [1.3.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.3.2...v1.3.3) - 2020-04-29

### :wrench: Changed

-   Update `pytest-subtests` pin to `>=0.2.1,<1.0`. [#537](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/537)

## [1.3.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.3.1...v1.3.2) - 2020-04-27

### :rocket: Added

-   Show exceptions if they happened during loading a WSGI application.
    Option `--show-errors-tracebacks` will display a full traceback.

## [1.3.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.3.0...v1.3.1) - 2020-04-27

### :bug: Fixed

-   Packaging issue

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.2.0...v1.3.0) - 2020-04-27

### :rocket: Added

-   Storing network logs with `--store-network-log=<filename.yaml>`. The
    stored cassettes are based on the [VCR
    format](https://relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/v/5-1-0/docs/cassettes/cassette-format)
    and contain extra information from the Schemathesis internals. [#379](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/379)
-   Replaying of cassettes stored in VCR format. [#519](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/519)
-   Targeted property-based testing in CLI and runner. It only supports
    the `response_time` target at the moment. [#104](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/104)
-   Export CLI test results to JUnit.xml with
    `--junit-xml=<filename.xml>`. [#427](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/427)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Code samples for schemas where `body` is defined as
    `{"type": "string"}`. [#521](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/521)
-   Showing error causes on internal `jsonschema` errors during input
    schema validation. [#513](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/513)
-   Recursion error in `response_schema_conformance` check. Because of
    this change, `Endpoint.definition` contains a definition where
    references are not resolved. In this way, it makes it possible to
    avoid recursion errors in `jsonschema` validation. [#468](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/468)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Added indentation & section name to the `SUMMARY` CLI block.
-   Use C-extension for YAML loading when it is possible. It can cause
    more than 10x speedup on schema parsing. Do not show Click's
    "Aborted!" message when an error occurs during CLI schema loading.
-   Add a help message to the CLI output when an internal exception
    happens. [#529](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/529)

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.1.2...v1.2.0) - 2020-04-15

### :rocket: Added

-   Per-test hooks for modification of data generation strategies. [#492](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/492)
-   Support for `x-example` vendor extension in Open API 2.0. [#504](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/504)
-   Sanity validation for the input schema & loader in `runner.prepare`. [#499](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/499)

## [1.1.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.1.1...v1.1.2) - 2020-04-14

### :bug: Fixed

-   Support for custom loaders in `runner`. Now all built-in loaders are
    supported as an argument to `runner.prepare`. [#496](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/496)
-   `from_wsgi` loader accepts custom keyword arguments that will be
    passed to `client.get` when accessing the schema. [#497](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/497)

## [1.1.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1) - 2020-04-12

### :bug: Fixed

-   Mistakenly applied Open API -\> JSON Schema Draft 7 conversion. It
    should be Draft 4. [#489](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/489)
-   Using wrong validator in `response_schema_conformance` check. It
    should be Draft 4 validator. [#468](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/468)

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.0.5...v1.1.0) - 2020-04-08

### :bug: Fixed

-   Response schema check for recursive schemas. [#468](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/468)

### :wrench: Changed

-   App loading in `runner`. Now it accepts application as an importable
    string, rather than an instance. It is done to make it possible to
    execute a runner in a subprocess. Otherwise, apps can't be easily
    serialized and transferred into another process.
-   Runner events structure. All data in events is static from now.
    There are no references to `BaseSchema`, `Endpoint` or similar
    objects that may calculate data dynamically. This is done to make
    events serializable and not tied to Python object, which decouples
    any `runner` consumer from implementation details. It will help make
    `runner` usable in more cases (e.g., web application) since events
    can be serialized to JSON and used in any environment. Another
    related change is that Python exceptions are not propagated
    anymore - they are replaced with the `InternalError` event that
    should be handled accordingly.

## [1.0.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.0.4...v1.0.5) - 2020-04-03

### :bug: Fixed

-   Open API 3. Handling of endpoints that contain `multipart/form-data`
    media types. Previously only file upload endpoints were working
    correctly. [#473](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/473)

## [1.0.4](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.0.3...v1.0.4) - 2020-04-03

### :bug: Fixed

-   `OpenApi30.get_content_types` behavior, introduced in
    [8aeee1a](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/commit/8aeee1ab2c6c97d94272dde4790f5efac3951aed). [#469](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/469)

## [1.0.3](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.0.2...v1.0.3) - 2020-04-03

### :bug: Fixed

-   Precedence of `produces` keywords for Swagger 2.0 schemas. Now,
    operation-level `produces` overrides schema-level `produces` as
    specified in the specification. [#463](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/463)
-   Content-type conformance check for Open API 3.0 schemas. [#461](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/461)
-   Pytest 5.4 warning for test functions without parametrization. [#451](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/451)

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.2) - 2020-04-02

### :bug: Fixed

-   Handling of fields in `paths` that are not operations, but allowed
    by the Open API spec. [#457](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/457)
-   Pytest 5.4 warning about deprecated `Node` initialization usage. [#451](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/451)

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1) - 2020-04-01

### :bug: Fixed

-   Processing of explicit examples in Open API 3.0 when there are
    multiple parameters in the same location (e.g. `path`) contain
    `example` value. They are properly combined now. [#450](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/450)

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v0.28.0...v1.0.0) - 2020-03-31

### :wrench: Changed

-   Move processing of `runner` parameters to `runner.prepare`. This
    change will provide better code reuse since all users of `runner`
    (e.g., if you extended it in your project) need some kind of input
    parameters handling, which was implemented only in Schemathesis CLI.
    It is not backward-compatible. If you didn't use `runner` directly,
    then this change should not have a visible effect on your use-case.

## [0.28.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v0.27.0...v0.28.0) - 2020-03-31

## [0.27.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v0.26.1...v0.27.0) - 2020-03-31

Deprecated

-   `runner.execute` should not be used, since `runner.prepare` provides
    a more flexible interface to test execution.

### :fire: Removed

-   Deprecated `Parametrizer` class. Use `schemathesis.from_path` as a
    replacement for `Parametrizer.from_path`.

## [0.26.1](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v0.26.0...v0.26.1) - 2020-03-24

    `"%2F"` url encoded. [#440](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/440)
-   Filter invalid empty `""` path template variables. [#439](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/439)
-   Typo in a help message in the CLI output. [#436](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/436)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Handling of explicit examples from schemas. Now, if there are
    examples for multiple locations (e.g., for body and query) then they
    will be combined into a single example. [#424](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/424)

## [0.24.5](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v0.24.4...v0.24.5) - 2020-02-26

### :bug: Fixed

-   Error during `pytest` collection on objects with custom
    `__getattr__` method and therefore pass `is_schemathesis` check. [#429](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/429)

    characters unrepresentable at the OS level. [#400](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/400)

## [0.24.0](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/compare/v0.23.7...v0.24.0) - 2020-02-07

### :rocket: Added

-   Support for testing of examples in Parameter & Media Type objects in
    Open API 3.0. [#394](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/394)
-   `--show-error-tracebacks` CLI option to display errors' tracebacks
    in the output. [#391](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/391)
-   Support for schema behind auth. [#115](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/115)

### :wrench: Changed

-   Schemas with GET endpoints accepting body are allowed now if schema
    validation is disabled (via `--validate-schema=false` for example).
    The use-case is for tools like ElasticSearch that use GET requests
    with non-empty bodies. [#383](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/383)

### :bug: Fixed

-   Handling binary request payloads in `Case.call`. [#350](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/issues/350)
-   Type of the second argument to all built-in checks set to proper
    `Case` instead of `TestResult`. The error was didn't affect built-in
    checks since both `Case` and `TestResult` had `endpoint` attribute,
    and only it was used. However, this fix is not backward-compatible
    with 3rd party checks.
