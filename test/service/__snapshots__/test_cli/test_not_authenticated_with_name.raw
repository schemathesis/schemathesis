Missing authentication for Schemathesis.io upload

You've specified an API name, suggesting you want to upload data to Schemathesis.io. However, your CLI is not currently authenticated.

To authenticate:
1. Retrieve your token from Schemathesis.io
2. Execute `st auth login <TOKEN>`

As an alternative, supply the token directly using the `--schemathesis-io-token` option or the `SCHEMATHESIS_TOKEN` environment variable.
