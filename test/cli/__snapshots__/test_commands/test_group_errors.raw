Serialization not possible

Schemathesis can't serialize data to any of the defined media types: text/csv, application/x-json-smile 
You can register your own serializer with `schemathesis.serializer` and Schemathesis will be able to make API calls with this media type. 
See https://schemathesis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how.html#payload-serialization for more information.
