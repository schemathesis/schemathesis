Schema Error

Cannot generate test data for request body (application/json)
Schema:

{
    "allOf": [
        {
            "type": "integer"
        },
        {
            "type": "string"
        }
    ]
}

This usually means:
  - Type mismatch (e.g., enum with strings but type: integer)
  - Contradictory constraints (e.g., minimum > maximum)
  - Regex that's too complex to generate values for

Tip: Review all parameters and request body schemas for conflicting constraints.
