Schema Error

Failed to generate test cases for this API operation. Possible reasons:

    - Contradictory schema constraints, such as a minimum value exceeding the maximum.
    - Excessive schema complexity, which hinders parameter generation.

Tip: Examine the schema for inconsistencies and consider simplifying it.
