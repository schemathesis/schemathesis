==================================== ERRORS ====================================
___________________________ PATCH /items/{item_id}/ ____________________________
Failed Health Check

Too many generated examples are filtered out for request body (application/json)
Schema:

{
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
        "A",
        "B",
        "C",
        "D"
    ],
    "type": "object"
}

This usually means:
  - Complex regex patterns that match few strings
  - Multiple overlapping constraints (pattern + format + enum)

Tip: Simplify constraints or widen acceptable value ranges or bypass this health check using `--suppress-health-check=filter_too_much`.

Schema Error

Path parameter 'item_id' is not defined
