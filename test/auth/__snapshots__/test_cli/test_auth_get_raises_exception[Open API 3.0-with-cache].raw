Authentication Error

Error in 'BrokenAuth.get()': 'str' object has no attribute 'get'

Common causes:
  - Auth endpoint returned an error response
  - Response format doesn't match expectations (text vs JSON)
  - Network or connection issues
  - Logic error in the authentication provider implementation

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/package-root/auths.py", line XXX, in get
        data: Auth = self.provider.get(case, context)  # type: ignore[assignment]
      File "/tmp/module.py", line XXX, in get
        raise AttributeError("'str' object has no attribute 'get'")
    AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
