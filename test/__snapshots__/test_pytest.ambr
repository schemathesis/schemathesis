  E   hypothesis.errors.FailedHealthCheck: Too many generated examples are filtered out for request body (application/json)
      Schema:
      
      {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "date-time",
          "pattern": "abc"
      }
      
      This usually means:
        - Complex regex patterns that match few strings
        - Multiple overlapping constraints (pattern + format + enum)
      
      Tip: Simplify constraints or widen acceptable value ranges. You can disable this health check with @settings(suppress_health_check=[HealthCheck.filter_too_much])

  E   hypothesis.errors.Unsatisfiable: Cannot generate test data for request body (application/json)
      Schema:
      
      {
          "allOf": [
              {
                  "type": "integer"
              },
              {
                  "type": "string"
              }
          ]
      }
      
      This usually means:
        - Type mismatch (e.g., enum with strings but type: integer)
        - Contradictory constraints (e.g., minimum > maximum)
        - Regex that's too complex to generate values for
      
      Tip: Review all parameters and request body schemas for conflicting constraints
