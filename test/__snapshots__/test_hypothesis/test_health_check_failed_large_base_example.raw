Failed Health Check

A health check has identified that the smallest example derived from the schema
is excessively large, potentially leading to inefficient test execution.

This is commonly due to schemas that specify large-scale data structures by
default, such as an array with an extensive number of elements.

Consider revising the schema to more accurately represent typical use cases
or applying constraints to reduce the data size.

Tip: Bypass this health check using `--suppress-health-check=large_base_example`.
