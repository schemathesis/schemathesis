Stdout:
The `--contrib-unique-data` CLI option and the corresponding `schemathesis.contrib.unique_data` hook are **DEPRECATED**. The concept of this feature does not fit the core principles of Hypothesis where strategies are configurable on a per-example basis but this feature implies uniqueness across examples. This leads to cryptic error messages about external state and flaky test runs, therefore it will be removed in Schemathesis 4.0
