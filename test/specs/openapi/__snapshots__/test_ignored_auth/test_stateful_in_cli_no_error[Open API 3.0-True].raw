=================================== FAILURES ===================================
________________________________ Stateful tests ________________________________
1. Test Case ID: <PLACEHOLDER>

- Authentication declared but not enforced for this operation

    The API returned `200 OK` for `GET /api/ignored_auth` that requires authentication.

[200] OK:

    `{"has_auth": false}`

Reproduce with: 

    curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1/api/ignored_auth

Note: Use the 'X-Schemathesis-TestCaseId' header to correlate test case ids from failure messages with server logs for debugging.

Note: To replicate these test failures, rerun with `--hypothesis-seed=42`

Tip: Use the `--report` CLI option to visualize test results via Schemathesis.io.
We run additional conformance checks on reports from public repos.
