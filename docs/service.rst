Schemathesis as a Service
=========================

This library integrates with the Schemathesis.io platform, where you can store, view, and track issues found by Schemathesis.

.. important::

    Schemathesis.io is currently in alpha and intended for testing only. If you want to try it out, ping me at **hello@schemathesis.io**.

Quickstart
----------

First, you need to add your API to Schemathesis.io by clicking on the "Add API" button and filling details in a form on that page:

Then get a token from the "Details" page by clicking on a little gear icon:

Then you can find an API token there. Note that tokens are unique per API:

Once you got an API token, you can use it with Schemathesis CLI. Integrations with ``pytest`` and ``unittest`` are in the works.

Command Line Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add ``--schemathesis-io-token=<YOUR API TOKEN>`` to your Schemathesis CLI invocation:

.. code:: bash

    schemathesis run http://127.0.0.1:8081/schema.yaml \
      --schemathesis-io-token=6656aeaaf89046ef9180f42f9929871e

Once all events are uploaded to Schemathesis.io you'll see a message at the end of the CLI output:

.. code:: text

    Schemathesis.io: SUCCESS
    Report URL: https://app.schemathesis.io/r/mF9ke/

To observe the test run results, follow the link from the output.

Features overview
-----------------

Schemathesis.io stores data about your test runs and aims to provide a convenient UI to navigate through found failures.
These failures are aggregated into groups, so you can track recurring ones.

You also have better failure description and an ability to replay failures from the UI:

You can use Schemathesis.io test runners instead of CLI. They have more checks & better data generation than Open Source Schemathesis.

.. important::

    Again, it is an alpha version and I am delighted to hear from you! Please, if you miss any feature or have any comments on this, let me know.

How it works
------------

The integration is done with a separate event handler that sends events to Schemathesis.io in a separate thread.

What data is sent to Schemathesis.io
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment, Schemathesis sends almost everything defined in ``schemathesis.runner.events``, so
you have all information needed to reproduce failures. However, it might change in the future.
