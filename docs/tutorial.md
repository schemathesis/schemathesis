# Schemathesis Tutorial

**Estimated time: 15-20 minutes**

This tutorial walks you through a complete API testing workflow with Schemathesis using a booking API. You'll see how property-based testing automatically finds bugs that manual testing typically misses.

!!! info "What you'll accomplish"

    By the end, you'll catch API bugs automatically and integrate Schemathesis into your development workflow.

If you're new to Schemathesis, check the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md) first.

## Prerequisites

 - **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){target=_blank}** - to clone the example API repository

 - **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/){target=_blank}** - Install Docker Desktop which includes Docker Compose

 - **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/){target=_blank}** - Python package manager that allows running Schemathesis without installation using `uvx`

 - **[curl](https://curl.se/download.html){target=_blank}** (optional) - for reproducing API failures manually

**Verify your setup:**

```console
git --version
docker compose version
uv --version
curl --version  # optional
```

## API under test

We'll test an example booking API that handles hotel reservations - creating bookings and retrieving guest information. This is a sample API designed to demonstrate common validation scenarios.

The API lives in the [Schemathesis repository](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/tree/master/examples/booking):

```console
git clone https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis.git
cd schemathesis/examples/basic
docker compose up -d
```
!!! success "Verify the API is running"

    Open [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs){target=_blank} - you should see the interactive API documentation.

!!! note "Authentication token"

    The API requires bearer token authentication. Use: `secret-token`

## First Test Run

Schemathesis automatically tests all API operations with various test types to find edge cases:

```bash
uvx schemathesis run http://127.0.0.1:8080/openapi.json \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer secret-token' \
  --output-sanitize false
```

**Key findings from the output:**

!!! failure "Bug discovered"
    ```
    ❌ Server error: 1
    ❌ Undocumented HTTP status code: 1
    
    Reproduce with:
    curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer secret-token' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"guest_name": "00", "nights": 1, "room_type": ""}' \
      http://127.0.0.1:8080/bookings
    ```

Empty `room_type` causes a 500 error because the pricing logic can't handle unexpected values.

Run the provided `curl` command to reproduce this failure.

## Reporting

Schemathesis can export test results in multiple formats for integration with existing tools and CI/CD pipelines. Let's generate a JUnit report that can be imported into Jenkins, GitLab CI, or other test management systems:

```bash
uvx schemathesis run http://127.0.0.1:8080/openapi.json \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer secret-token' \
  --output-sanitize false \
  --report junit
```

This creates a `junit.xml` file in the `schemathesis-report` directory containing structured test results. The JUnit format includes:

- Test case details and execution times
- Failure descriptions with reproduction steps

You can customize the output location using `--report-junit-path` or change the report directory with `--report-dir`. Other available formats include VCR cassettes (`--report vcr`) and HAR files (`--report har`) for detailed HTTP traffic analysis.

## Fixing the bug

!!! bug "Root cause"
    The schema allows any string for `room_type`, but our pricing logic only handles specific values.


**Fix: Constrain room types in the schema**

=== "Before (broken)"
    ```python
    class BookingRequest(BaseModel):
        room_type: str  # Any string allowed!
    ```

=== "After (fixed)"
    ```python
    from enum import Enum
    
    class RoomType(str, Enum):
        standard = "standard"
        deluxe = "deluxe" 
        suite = "suite"
    
    class BookingRequest(BaseModel):
        room_type: RoomType  # Only valid values
    ```

**Don't forget to restart:**

```bash
docker compose restart
```

## Re-running the tests

Now let's verify our fix by re-running the tests. Focus on the operation you just fixed:

```bash
uvx schemathesis run http://127.0.0.1:8080/openapi.json \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer secret-token' \
  --output-sanitize false \
  --include-operation-id create_booking_bookings_post
```

!!! success "Expected result"
    You should see no failures for the `POST /bookings` operation. The 500 error is now prevented.
!!! info "Operation ID explained"
    FastAPI generates operation IDs automatically. You can find them in the OpenAPI schema or API docs.

The `--include-operation-id` option targets only the specific operation we fixed, making the test run faster during development. You can also filter by HTTP method (`--include-method POST`) or path patterns (`--include-path /bookings`).

## Generating more test cases

!!! question "Want to find more bugs?"
    By default, Schemathesis stops at the first failure per operation and runs a limited number of test cases. Let's be more thorough:

```bash
uvx schemathesis run http://127.0.0.1:8080/openapi.json \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer secret-token' \
  --output-sanitize false \
  --max-examples 500 \
  --continue-on-failure
```

**`--max-examples 500`** generates more test cases per operation, increasing the chance of finding edge cases that smaller test runs might miss.

**`--continue-on-failure`** prevents Schemathesis from stopping at the first failure, allowing it to discover multiple issues on the same API operation in a single run.

These options are particularly valuable when:

- Preparing for production releases
- Testing complex validation logic

The trade-off is longer execution time, but you'll get more chances to find bugs.

## Configuration File

!!! question "Tired of long command lines?"
    Instead of repeating long commands, save your settings once and reuse them across your team.

**Create `schemathesis.toml` in your project:**

```toml
# Core settings from our previous commands
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" }
continue-on-failure = true

[output.sanitization]
enabled = false

[generation] 
max-examples = 500

[reports.junit]
enabled = true
```

!!! tip "Environment variables"
    ```bash
    export API_TOKEN=secret-token
    ```

**Now run with just:**
```bash
uvx schemathesis run http://127.0.0.1:8080/openapi.json
```

Schemathesis automatically loads `schemathesis.toml` from the current directory or project root. You can specify a custom configuration file:

```bash
uvx schemathesis --config-file path/to/config.toml run http://...
```

!!! info "Configuration precedence"
    CLI options override config file settings, so you can still adjust settings temporarily.
