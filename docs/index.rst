Schemathesis: catch crashes, validate specs, and save time
==========================================================

Schemathesis focuses on automating your API testing to catch crashes and spec violations.
Built on top of the widely-used `Hypothesis <http://hypothesis.works/>`_ framework for property-based testing, it offers the following advantages:

- üïí **Time-Saving**: Automatically generates test cases, freeing you from manual test writing.
- üîç **Comprehensive**: Utilizes fuzzing techniques for both common and edge-case scenarios.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible**: Supports OpenAPI and GraphQL. Operates even with partially complete schemas.
- üéõÔ∏è **Customizable**: Extend almost any aspect of the testing process through Python.
- üîÑ **Reproducible**: Generates code samples for quick replication of any failing test cases.

Getting Started
===============

Choose from multiple ways to start testing your API with Schemathesis.

.. note:: Your API schema can be either a URL or a local path to a JSON/YAML file.

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

Quick and easy for those who prefer the command line.

Python
^^^^^^

1. Install via pip: ``python -m pip install schemathesis``
2. Run tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   st run --checks all https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json

Docker
^^^^^^

1. Pull Docker image: ``docker pull schemathesis/schemathesis:stable``
2. Run tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run schemathesis/schemathesis:stable
      run --checks all https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json

Python Library
--------------

For more control and customization, integrate Schemathesis into your Python codebase.

1. Install via pip: ``python -m pip install schemathesis``
2. Add to your tests:

.. code-block:: python

   import schemathesis

   schema = schemathesis.from_uri("https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json")


   @schema.parametrize()
   def test_api(case):
       case.call_and_validate()

.. note:: See a complete working example project in the `/example <https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/tree/master/example>`_ directory.

GitHub Integration
------------------

GitHub Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run Schemathesis tests as a part of your CI/CD pipeline. Add this YAML configuration to your GitHub Actions:

.. code-block:: yaml

   api-tests:
     runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
     steps:
       - uses: schemathesis/action@v1
         with:
           schema: "https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json"
           # OPTIONAL. Add Schemathesis.io token for pull request reports
           token: ${{ secrets.SCHEMATHESIS_TOKEN }}

For more details, check out our `GitHub Action <https://github.com/schemathesis/action>`_ repository.

GitHub App
^^^^^^^^^^

Receive automatic comments in your pull requests and updates on GitHub checks status. Requires usage of our `SaaS platform <https://app.schemathesis.io/auth/sign-up/?utm_source=oss_docs&utm_content=index_note>`_.

1. Install the `GitHub app <https://github.com/apps/schemathesis>`_.
2. Enable in your repository settings.

Software as a Service
---------------------

If you prefer an all-in-one solution with quick setup, we have a `free tier <https://schemathesis.io/#pricing>`_ available.

How it Works
============

Here‚Äôs a simplified overview of how Schemathesis operates:

1. **Test Generation**: Using the API schema to create a test generator that you can fine-tune to your testing requirements.
2. **Execution and Adaptation**: Sending tests to the API and adapting through statistical models and heuristics to optimize subsequent cases based on responses.
3. **Analysis and Minimization**: Checking responses to identify issues. Minimizing means simplifying failing test cases for easier debugging.
4. **Stateful Testing**: Running multistep tests to assess API operations in both isolated and integrated scenarios.
5. **Reporting**: Generating detailed reports with insights and cURL commands for easy issue reproduction.

Research Findings on Open-Source API Testing Tools
--------------------------------------------------

Our study, presented at the **44th International Conference on Software Engineering**, highlighted Schemathesis's performance:

- **Defect Detection**: identified a total of **755 bugs** in **16 services**, finding between **1.4√ó to 4.5√ó more defects** than the second-best tool in each case.
- **High Reliability**: consistently operates seamlessly on any project, ensuring unwavering stability and reliability.
