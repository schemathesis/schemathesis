Experimental features
=====================

Introduction
------------

This section provides an overview of experimental features in Schemathesis - features that are under development and available for testing, but not yet considered stable.

This section provides an overview of experimental features in Schemathesis.
These are features that are under development, available for user testing but not yet stable.
Experimental features offer a glimpse into upcoming functionalities and enhancements, providing users an opportunity to try out and contribute feedback to shape their final form.

.. note::

   Experimental features can change or be removed in any minor version release.

Enabling Experimental Features
------------------------------

Schemathesis provides a few ways to enable experimental features: via the CLI, Python tests, and environment variables.

.. _experimental-cli:

In CLI
~~~~~~

To enable an experimental feature via the CLI, use the ``--experimental`` option.

For example, to enable experimental support for OpenAPI 3.1:

.. code-block:: bash

   st run https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json --experimental=openapi-3.1

.. _experimental-python:

In Python Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable experimental features globally across all your Schemathesis tests, you can use the ``enable`` method on the desired experimental feature.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    import schemathesis

    # Globally enable OpenAPI 3.1 experimental feature
    schemathesis.experimental.openapi_3_1.enable()

By doing this, all schemas loaded afterwards will automatically use the enabled experimental features.

.. note::

    Enabling an experimental feature globally will affect all your tests. Use this feature with caution.

Using Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also enable experimental features through environment variables. This is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines or when you don't have direct control over CLI arguments or test code.

For example, to enable experimental support for OpenAPI 3.1:

.. code-block:: bash

    export SCHEMATHESIS_EXPERIMENTAL_OPENAPI_3_1=true

This will enable the OpenAPI 3.1 experimental feature for any Schemathesis runs in the same environment.

Current Experimental Features
-----------------------------

.. _experimental-openapi-31:

Open API 3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provides partial support for OpenAPI 3.1. This includes compatible JSON Schema validation for API responses.
Note that data generation is still compatible only with OpenAPI 3.0.

Enabling this feature also automatically enables UUID format support.

.. _openapi-31-cli:

In CLI
~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   st run https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json --experimental=openapi-3.1

.. _openapi-31-python:

In Python Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    import schemathesis

    # Globally enable OpenAPI 3.1 experimental feature
    schemathesis.experimental.openapi_3_1.enable()

.. _openapi-31-env-vars:

Using Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable OpenAPI 3.1 support via environment variables, you can set:

.. code-block:: bash

    export SCHEMATHESIS_EXPERIMENTAL_OPENAPI_3_1=true

Stabilization of Experimental Features
--------------------------------------

Criteria for moving a feature from experimental to stable status include:

- Full coverage of planned functionality
- API design stability, assessed through user feedback and internal review

Providing Feedback
------------------

Feedback is crucial for the development and stabilization of experimental features. We encourage you to share your thoughts via `GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/discussions>`_

.. note::

   When you use an experimental feature, a notice will appear in your test output, providing a link to the corresponding GitHub discussion where you can leave feedback.
