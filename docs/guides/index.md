## **[Extending Schemathesis](extending.md)**
Customize test data generation and validation through hooks, custom checks, and Open API "format" strategies. Essential for making tests work with realistic.

## **[Extending CLI](extending-cli.md)**
Add custom command-line options and event handlers to integrate Schemathesis with external tools or custom reporting.

## **[GraphQL Custom Scalars](graphql-custom-scalars.md)**
Configure custom scalar types in GraphQL schemas so Schemathesis generates appropriate test data for domain-specific types like emails, phone numbers, or custom IDs.

## **[Targeted Testing](targeted.md)**
Use property-based testing strategies to find performance issues and edge cases faster by directing test generation toward specific goals like maximizing response times.
