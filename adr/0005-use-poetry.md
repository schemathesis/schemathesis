# 5. Use poetry

Date: 2019-08-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There is a new standardized file named `pyproject.toml` that introduce
simplified way of python packaging and dependency management.

## Decision

We will use [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/).

## Consequences

Using PEP 518 simplifies distribution as we have only pyproject.toml
