Schemathesis
============

|Build| |Coverage| |Version| |Python versions| |Docs| |Chat| |License|

Schemathesis is a modern API testing tool for web applications built with Open API and GraphQL specifications.

It reads the application schema and generates test cases, which will ensure that your application is compliant with its schema (read more about how it works in `our research paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10328>`_).

The application under test could be written in any language; the only thing you need is a valid API schema in a supported format.

Simple to use and yet powerful to uncover hard-to-find errors thanks to the property-based testing approach backed by state-of-the-art `Hypothesis <http://hypothesis.works/>`_ library.

Features
--------

- Content-Type, schema, and status code conformance checks for Open API;
- Testing of explicit examples from the input schema;
- Stateful testing via Open API links;
- Concurrent test execution;
- Targeted testing;
- Storing and replaying network requests;
- Built-in ASGI / WSGI application support;
- Code samples for easy failure reproduction;
- Ready-to-go Docker image;
- Configurable with user-defined checks, string formats, hooks, and targets.

ðŸ“£ Schemathesis as a Service ðŸ“£
-------------------------------

Schemathesis will be available as `SaaS <https://schemathesis.io/?utm_source=github>`_ soon!

It is freemium with much better visuals for debugging, more checks, and static analysis :)

`Signup <http://eepurl.com/hN-0H1>`_ to get notified when it is ready!

Installation
------------

To install Schemathesis via ``pip`` run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    pip install schemathesis

This command installs the ``schemathesis`` entrypoint + ``st`` as its alias.

You can also use our Docker image without installing Schemathesis as a Python package.

ðŸ“£ **Please fill out our** `quick survey <https://forms.gle/dv4s5SXAYWzvuwFWA>`_ so that we can learn how satisfied you are with Schemathesis, and what improvements we should make. Thank you!

Usage
-----

You can use Schemathesis in the command line directly (``st`` is an alias to ``schemathesis``):

.. code:: bash

  st run --checks all https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json

Or via Docker:

.. code:: bash

  docker run schemathesis/schemathesis:stable \
      run --checks all https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/master/img/schemathesis.gif

Or in your Python tests:

.. code:: python

    import schemathesis

    schema = schemathesis.from_uri("https://example.schemathesis.io/openapi.json")


    @schema.parametrize()
    def test_api(case):
        case.call_and_validate()

CLI is simple to use and requires no coding; the in-code approach gives more flexibility.

Both examples above will run hundreds of requests against the API under test and report all found failures and inconsistencies along with instructions to reproduce them.
