Schemathesis
============

|Build| |Coverage| |Version| |Python versions| |Docs| |Chat| |License|

Schemathesis is a modern API testing tool for web applications built with Open API and GraphQL specifications.

It reads the application schema and generates test cases, which will ensure that your application is compliant with its schema.

Simple to use and yet powerful to uncover hard-to-find errors thanks to the property-based testing approach backed by state-of-the-art `Hypothesis <http://hypothesis.works/>`_ library.

The application under test could be written in any language; the only thing you need is a valid API schema in a supported format.

Features
--------

- Content-Type, schema, and status code conformance checks for Open API;
- Testing of explicit examples from the input schema;
- Stateful testing via Open API links;
- Concurrent test execution;
- Targeted testing;
- Storing and replaying network requests;
- Built-in ASGI / WSGI application support;
- Ready-to-go Docker image;
- Configurable with user-defined checks, string formats, hooks, and targets.

Installation
------------

To install Schemathesis via ``pip`` run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    pip install schemathesis

Usage
-----

You can use Schemathesis in the command line:

.. code:: bash

  schemathesis run --stateful=links --checks all http://0.0.0.0:8081/schema.yaml

Or in your Python tests:

.. code:: python

    import schemathesis

    schema = schemathesis.from_uri("http://example.com/swagger.json")

    @schema.parametrize()
    def test_api(case):
        response = case.call()
        case.validate_response(response)

CLI is pretty simple to use and requires no coding; the in-code approach gives more flexibility.
