Submitting Pull Requests
------------------------

We welcome contributions to the codebase! If you'd like to submit a pull request (PR), please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the Schemathesis repository on GitHub.
2. **Install Development Tools**: Install the development dependencies using the following command:

This will install all the necessary packages for development, including those for documentation and tests.

3. **Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**: Enable `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_.

.. code:: bash

    pre-commit install

4. **Branching**: Create a new branch and switch to it. Target your pull request to the ``master`` branch of the main repository.
5. **Coding Standards**: Follow `PEP-8 <https://pep8.org/>`_ for naming conventions and use `ruff <https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff>`_ for code formatting.
6. **Write Tests**: Preferably, write integration tests that run the whole Schemathesis CLI.
7. **Run Tests**:

.. code:: bash

    tox -e py39

8. **Update Changelog**: Add a corresponding entry to ``changelog.rst`` located in the ``docs`` directory.
9. **Commit Your Changes**: Use the `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/>`_ format. For example, features could be ``feat: add new validation feature`` and bug fixes could be ``fix: resolve issue with validation``.

**What happens next?**: After submitting, your pull request will be reviewed.
If you don't hear back within a few days, feel free to add a comment to the pull request to draw our attention.
